Last updated on **Apr 18, 2025**

As a cloud architect, when you evaluate a data lakehouse implementation on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, you might want to know “What is a *good* lakehouse?” The *Well-architected lakehouse* articles provide guidance for lakehouse implementation.

At the outset, you might also want to know:

* What is the scope of the lakehouse - in terms of capabilities and personas?
* What is the vision for the lakehouse?
* How does the lakehouse integrate with the customer's cloud architecture?

## Articles about lakehouse architecture[​](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-architecture/index.html#articles-about-lakehouse-architecture "Direct link to Articles about lakehouse architecture")

### The scope of the lakehouse[​](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-architecture/index.html#the-scope-of-the-lakehouse "Direct link to The scope of the lakehouse")

The first step to designing your data architecture with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform is understanding its building blocks and how they would integrate with your systems. See [The scope of the lakehouse platform](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/lakehouse-architecture/scope).

### Guiding principles for the lakehouse[​](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-architecture/index.html#guiding-principles-for-the-lakehouse "Direct link to Guiding principles for the lakehouse")

Ground rules that define and influence your architecture. They explain the vision behind a lakehouse implementation and form the basis for future decisions on your data, analytics, and AI architecture. See [Guiding principles for the lakehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/lakehouse-architecture/guiding-principles).

### Downloadable lakehouse reference architectures[​](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-architecture/index.html#downloadable-lakehouse-reference-architectures "Direct link to Downloadable lakehouse reference architectures")

Downloadable architecture blueprints outline the recommended setup of the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform and its integration with cloud providers' services. For reference architecture PDFs in 11 x 17 (A3) format, see [Lakehouse reference architectures (download)](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/lakehouse-architecture/reference).

### The seven pillars of the well-architected lakehouse, their principles, and best practices[​](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-architecture/index.html#the-seven-pillars-of-the-well-architected-lakehouse-their-principles-and-best-practices "Direct link to The seven pillars of the well-architected lakehouse, their principles, and best practices")

Understand the pros and cons of decisions you make when building the lakehouse. This framework provides architectural best practices for developing and operating a safe, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective lakehouse. See [Data lakehouse architecture: Databricks well-architected framework](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/lakehouse-architecture/well-architected).
