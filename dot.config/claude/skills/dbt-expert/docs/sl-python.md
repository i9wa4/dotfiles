The [`dbt-sl-sdk` Python software development kit](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python) (SDK) is a Python library that provides you with easy access to the dbt Semantic Layer with Python. It allows developers to interact with the dbt Semantic Layer APIs and query metrics and dimensions in downstream tools.

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

To install the Python SDK, you'll need to specify optional dependencies depending on whether you want to use it synchronously, backed by [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/), or with asynchronous ([asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) backed by [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/)).

The Python SDK supports the Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Python, such as 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. When Python discontinues support for a version, the Python SDK will also discontinue support for that version. If you’re using a non-supported version, you may experience compatibility issues and won’t receive updates or security patches from the SDK.

* Sync installation* Async installation

Sync installation means your program waits for each task to finish before moving on to the next one.

It's simpler, easier to understand, and suitable for smaller tasks or when your program doesn't need to handle many tasks at the same time.

```
pip install "dbt-sl-sdk[sync]"
```

If you're using async frameworks like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) or [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry), installing the sync version of the SDK will block your event loop and can significantly slow down your program. In this case, we strongly recommend using async installation.

Async installation means your program can start a task and then move on to other tasks while waiting for the first one to finish. This can handle many tasks at once without waiting, making it faster and more efficient for larger tasks or when you need to manage multiple tasks at the same time.

For more details, refer to [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

```
pip install "dbt-sl-sdk[sync]"
```

Since the [Python ADBC driver](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/tree/main/python/adbc_driver_manager) doesn't yet support asyncio natively, `dbt-sl-sdk` uses a [`ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/5e52e1ca840d20a143b226ae33d194a4a9bc008f/dbtsl/api/adbc/client/asyncio.py#L62) to run `query` and `list dimension-values` (all operations that are done with ADBC). This is why you might see multiple Python threads spawning.

If you're using async frameworks like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) or [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry), installing the sync version of the Python SDK will block your event loop and can significantly slow down your program. In this case, we strongly recommend using async installation.

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

To run operations against the Semantic Layer APIs, instantiate (create an instance of) a `SemanticLayerClient` with your specific [API connection parameters](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview):

```
from dbtsl import SemanticLayerClient

client = SemanticLayerClient(
    environment_id=123,
    auth_token="<your-semantic-layer-api-token>",
    host="semantic-layer.cloud.getdbt.com",
)

# query the first metric by `metric_time`
def main():
    with client.session():
        metrics = client.metrics()
        table = client.query(
            metrics=[metrics[0].name],
            group_by=["metric_time"],
        )
        print(table)

main()
```

**Note**: All method calls that reach out to the APIs need to be within a `client.session()` context manager. This allows the client to establish a connection to the APIs only once and reuse the same connection between API calls.

We recommend creating an application-wide session and reusing the same session throughout the application for optimal performance. Creating a session per request is discouraged and inefficient.

### asyncio usage[​](#asyncio-usage "Direct link to asyncio usage")

If you're using asyncio, import `AsyncSemanticLayerClient` from `dbtsl.asyncio`. The `SemanticLayerClient` and `AsyncSemanticLayerClient` APIs are identical, but the async version has async methods that you need to `await`.

```
import asyncio
from dbtsl.asyncio import AsyncSemanticLayerClient

client = AsyncSemanticLayerClient(
    environment_id=123,
    auth_token="<your-semantic-layer-api-token>",
    host="semantic-layer.cloud.getdbt.com",
)

async def main():
    async with client.session():
        metrics = await client.metrics()
        table = await client.query(
            metrics=[metrics[0].name],
            group_by=["metric_time"],
        )
        print(table)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Lazy loading for large fields[​](#lazy-loading-for-large-fields "Direct link to Lazy loading for large fields")

By default, the Python SDK eagerly loads nested lists of objects such as `dimensions`, `entities`, and `measures` for each `Metric` — even if you don't need them. This is generally convenient, but in large projects, it can lead to slower responses due to the amount of data returned.

To improve performance, you can opt into lazy loading by passing `lazy=True` when creating the client. With lazy loading enabled, the SDK skips fetching large nested fields until you explicitly request them on a per-model basis.

Lazy loading is currently only supported for `dimensions`, `entities`, and `measures` on `Metric` objects.

For example, the following code fetches all available metrics from the metadata API and displays only the dimensions of certain metrics:

list\_metrics\_lazy\_sync.py

```
"""Fetch all available metrics from the metadata API and display only the dimensions of certain metrics."""

from argparse import ArgumentParser

from dbtsl import SemanticLayerClient


def get_arg_parser() -> ArgumentParser:
    p = ArgumentParser()

    p.add_argument("--env-id", required=True, help="The dbt environment ID", type=int)
    p.add_argument("--token", required=True, help="The API auth token")
    p.add_argument("--host", required=True, help="The API host")

    return p


def main() -> None:
    arg_parser = get_arg_parser()
    args = arg_parser.parse_args()

    client = SemanticLayerClient(
        environment_id=args.env_id,
        auth_token=args.token,
        host=args.host,
        lazy=True,
    )

    with client.session():
        metrics = client.metrics()
        for i, m in enumerate(metrics):
            print(f"📈 {m.name}")
            print(f"     type={m.type}")
            print(f"     description={m.description}")

            assert len(m.dimensions) == 0

            # skip if index is odd
            if i & 1:
                print("     dimensions=skipped")
                continue

            # load dimensions only if index is even
            m.load_dimensions()

            print("     dimensions=[")
            for dim in m.dimensions:
                print(f"        {dim.name},")
            print("     ]")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Refer to the [lazy loading example](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/list_metrics_lazy_sync.py) for more details.

## Integrate with dataframe libraries[​](#integrate-with-dataframe-libraries "Direct link to Integrate with dataframe libraries")

The Python SDK returns all query data as [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) tables.

The Python SDK library doesn't come bundled with [Polars](https://pola.rs/) or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). If you use these libraries, add them as dependencies in your project.

To use the data with libraries like Polars or Pandas, manually convert the data into the desired format. For example:

#### If you're using pandas[​](#if-youre-using-pandas "Direct link to If you're using pandas")

```
# ... initialize client

arrow_table = client.query(...)
pandas_df = arrow_table.to_pandas()
```

#### If you're using polars[​](#if-youre-using-polars "Direct link to If you're using polars")

```
import polars as pl

# ... initialize client

arrow_table = client.query(...)
polars_df = pl.from_arrow(arrow_table)
```

## Usage examples[​](#usage-examples "Direct link to Usage examples")

For additional usage examples, check out the [usage examples](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/tree/main/examples), some of which include:

* [Fetching dimension values sync](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/fetch_dimension_values_sync.py)
* Fetching metrics [async](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/fetch_metric_async.py) and [sync](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/fetch_metric_sync.py)
* [List saved queries async](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/list_saved_queries_async.py)

## Disable telemetry[​](#disable-telemetry "Direct link to Disable telemetry")

By default, the Python SDK sends some [platform-related information](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python/blob/main/dbtsl/env.py) to dbt Labs. To opt-out, set the `PLATFORM.anonymous` attribute to `True`:

```
from dbtsl.env import PLATFORM
PLATFORM.anonymous = True

# ... initialize client
```
