## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

I joined the dbt community in 2022. My current focus is on building modern data teams. There is no magic formula for structuring your analytics function. Given the pace of technological change in our industry, the structure of a data team must evolve over time.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#what-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

I like working with dbt Labs' Sean McIntyre to promote Data Vault in Europe and Victoria Perez Mola, also from dbt Labs, is always a great help when I have questions about dbt.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I just think it's good to have a community, to be able to ask questions and get good answers.

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?[​](#anything-else-interesting-you-want-to-tell-us "Direct link to Anything else interesting you want to tell us?")

Data Vault is actively looking forward to supporting the messaging that dbt (+packages) is a real alternative that works.
