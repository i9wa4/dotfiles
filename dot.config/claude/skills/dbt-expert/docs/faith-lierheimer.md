## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

I joined the dbt community early in 2022 hoping to find technical help with dbt, and instead found a wide support network of career-minded data professionals. Being in the dbt community has helped me find my niche in the data world, and has helped me discover ways I can grow my career and technical acumen. Being in this community has been huge in easing my career transition from teaching into data.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#what-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

I primarily conceptualize of leadership as raising the floor beneath everyone, rather than enabling a few to touch its vaulted ceiling. As I gain more experience, I'd be delighted to be a resource for fellow career changers and teachers in transition.

And, I love to goof in #roast-my-graph in the dbt Slack. [Come join](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community/?utm_medium=internal&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=q3-2024_dbt-spotlight_aw&utm_content=____&utm_term=all___) that channel, it's a hoot and a holler.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I've learned a lot from community members, but most notably and concretely, I've actually gotten excellent visualization advice in #roast-my-graph. I've taken graphs there several times where I felt stuck on the presentation and have learned a lot about effective vizzes from my peers there.

As I continue to gain experience, I hope others can learn from me what a successful career change looks like. And, ultimately, to take the work seriously but to not take ourselves that seriously.

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?[​](#anything-else-interesting-you-want-to-tell-us "Direct link to Anything else interesting you want to tell us?")

I have a black cat with one eye named Gus and my purpose is now to give him the best existence possible.
