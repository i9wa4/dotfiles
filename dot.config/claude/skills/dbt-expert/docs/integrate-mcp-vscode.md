[Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp) is a powerful and popular integrated development environment (IDE).

These instructions are for integrating dbt MCP and VS Code. Before starting, ensure you have:

* Completed the [local MCP setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-ai/setup-local-mcp)
* Installed VS Code with the latest updates
* (For local MCP with CLI) Configured your dbt project paths

## Set up with local dbt MCP server[​](#set-up-with-local-dbt-mcp-server "Direct link to Set up with local dbt MCP server")

To get started, in VS Code:

1. Open the **Settings** menu and select the correct tab atop the page for your use case:

   * **Workspace**: Configures the server in the context of your workspace
   * **User**: Configures the server in the context of your user

   **Note for WSL users**: If you're using VS Code with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you'll need to configure WSL-specific settings. Run the **Preferences: Open Remote Settings** command from the **Command Palette** (F1) or select the **Remote** tab in the **Settings** editor. Local user settings are reused in WSL but can be overridden with WSL-specific settings. Configuring MCP servers in the local user settings will not work properly in a WSL environment.
2. Select **Features** --> **Chat**
3. Ensure that **MCP** is **Enabled**

[![mcp-vscode-settings](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/mcp/vscode_mcp_enabled_image.png?v=2 "mcp-vscode-settings")](#)mcp-vscode-settings

4. Open the command palette `Control/Command + Shift + P`, and select either:

   * **MCP: Open Workspace Folder MCP Configuration** — if you want to install the MCP server for this workspace
   * **MCP: Open User Configuration** — if you want to install the MCP server for the user
5. Add your server configuration (`dbt`) to the provided `mcp.json` file as one of the servers:

    Local MCP with dbt platform OAuth

   Local MCP with OAuth is for users who want to use the dbt platform features.

   Choose your configuration based on your use case:

   * dbt platform only* dbt platform + CLI

   This option is for users who only want dbt platform features (Discovery API, Semantic Layer, job management) without local CLI commands.

   When you use only the dbt platform, the CLI tools are automatically disabled. You can find the `DBT_HOST` field value in your dbt platform account information under **Access URLs**.

   ```
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "dbt": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["dbt-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "DBT_HOST": "https://<your-dbt-host-with-custom-subdomain>",
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Replace `<your-dbt-host-with-custom-subdomain>` with your actual host (for example, `abc123.us1.dbt.com`). This enables OAuth authentication without requiring local dbt installation.

   This option is for users who want both dbt CLI commands and dbt platform features (Discovery API, Semantic Layer, job management).

   The `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` and `DBT_PATH` fields are required for CLI access. You can find the `DBT_HOST` field value in your dbt platform account information under **Access URLs**.

   ```
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "dbt": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["dbt-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "DBT_HOST": "https://<your-dbt-host-with-custom-subdomain>",
           "DBT_PROJECT_DIR": "/path/to/project",
           "DBT_PATH": "/path/to/dbt/executable"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Replace `<your-dbt-host-with-custom-subdomain>` with your actual host (for example, `https://abc123.us1.dbt.com`). This enables OAuth authentication.

    Local MCP (CLI only)

   For users who only want to use dbt CLI commands with dbt Core or Fusion

   ```
   {
     "servers": {
       "dbt": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["dbt-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "DBT_PROJECT_DIR": "/path/to/your/dbt/project",
           "DBT_PATH": "/path/to/your/dbt/executable"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Finding your paths:**
   * **DBT\_PROJECT\_DIR**: Full path to the folder containing your `dbt_project.yml` file
     + macOS/Linux: Run `pwd` from your project folder.
     + Windows: Run `cd` from your project folder in Command Prompt.
   * **DBT\_PATH**: Path to dbt executable
     + macOS/Linux: Run `which dbt`.
     + Windows: Run `where dbt`.

    Local MCP with .env

   For advanced users who need custom environment variables or service token authentication

   Using the `env` field (recommended - single-file configuration):

   ```
   {
     "servers": {
       "dbt": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["dbt-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "DBT_HOST": "cloud.getdbt.com",
           "DBT_TOKEN": "your-token-here",
           "DBT_PROD_ENV_ID": "12345",
           "DBT_PROJECT_DIR": "/path/to/project",
           "DBT_PATH": "/path/to/dbt"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Using an `.env` file (alternative - two-file configuration):

   ```
   {
     "servers": {
       "dbt": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["--env-file", "/path/to/.env", "dbt-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
6. You can start, stop, and configure your MCP servers by:

   * Running the `MCP: List Servers` command from the Command Palette (Control/Command + Shift + P) and selecting the server.
   * Utilizing the keywords inline within the `mcp.json` file.

[![VS Code inline management](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/mcp/vscode_run_server_keywords_inline.png?v=2 "VS Code inline management")](#)VS Code inline management

Now, you can access the dbt MCP server in VS Code through interfaces like GitHub Copilot.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

This section contains troubleshooting steps for errors you might encounter when integrating VS Code with MCP.

 Cannot find `uvx` executable

If you see errors like `Could not connect to MCP server dbt` or `spawn uvx ENOENT`, VS Code may be unable to find the `uvx` executable.

To resolve, use the full path to `uvx` in your configuration:

1. Find the full path:

   * macOS/Linux: Run `which uvx` in Terminal.
   * Windows: Run `where uvx` in Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Update your `mcp.json` to use the full path:

   ```
   {
     "servers": {
       "dbt": {
         "command": "/full/path/to/uvx",
         "args": ["dbt-mcp"],
         "env": { ... }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Example on macOS with Homebrew: `"command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uvx"`

 Configuration not working in WSL

If you're using VS Code with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), make sure you've configured the MCP server in the WSL-specific settings, not the local user settings. Use the **Remote** tab in the Settings editor or run **Preferences: Open Remote Settings** from the Command Palette.

 Server not starting

Check the MCP server status:

1. Run `MCP: List Servers` from the Command Palette (Control/Command + Shift + P).
2. Look for any error messages next to the dbt server.
3. Click on the server to see detailed logs.

Common issues:

* Missing or incorrect paths for `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` or `DBT_PATH`
* Invalid authentication tokens
* Missing required environment variables
