The `flags` variable contains values of flags provided on the command line.

**Example usage:**

flags.sql

```
{% if flags.FULL_REFRESH %}
drop table ...
{% else %}
-- no-op
{% endif %}
```

The list of available flags is defined in the [`flags` module](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/HEAD/core/dbt/flags.py) within `dbt-core`.

Recommended use cases include:

* different materialization logic based on "run modes," such as `flags.FULL_REFRESH` and `flags.STORE_FAILURES`
* running hooks conditionally based on the current command / task type, via `flags.WHICH`

**Note:** It is *not* recommended to use flags as an input to parse-time configurations, properties, or dependencies (`ref` + `source`). Flags are likely to change in every invocation of dbt, and their parsed values will become stale (and yield incorrect results) in subsequent invocations that have partial parsing enabled. For more details, see [the docs on parsing](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/parsing).

### invocation\_args\_dict[​](#invocation_args_dict "Direct link to invocation_args_dict")

For the full set of information passed from the CLI—subcommand, flags, arguments—you can use `invocation_args_dict`. This is equivalent to the `args` dictionary in [`run_results.json`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json).

models/my\_model.sql

```
-- invocation_args_dict:
-- {{ invocation_args_dict }}

-- dbt_metadata_envs:
-- {{ dbt_metadata_envs }}

select 1 as id
```

The `invocation_command` key within `invocation_args_dict` includes the entire subcommand when it compiles:

```
$ DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_MYVAR=myvalue dbt compile -s my_model

-- dbt_metadata_envs:
-- {'MYVAR': 'myvalue'}

select 1 as id
```

## flags.WHICH[​](#flagswhich "Direct link to flags.WHICH")

`flags.WHICH` is a global variable that gets set when you run a dbt command. If used in a macro, it allows you to conditionally change behavior depending on the command currently being executed. For example, conditionally modifying SQL:

```
{% macro conditional_filter(table_name) %}
    {# Add a WHERE clause only during `dbt run`, not during `dbt test` or `dbt compile` #}

    select *
    from {{ table_name }}
    {% if flags.WHICH == "run" %}
        where is_active = true
    {% elif flags.WHICH == "test" %}
        -- In test runs, restrict rows to keep tests fast
        limit 10
    {% elif flags.WHICH == "compile" %}
        -- During compile, just add a harmless comment
        -- compile mode detected
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```
