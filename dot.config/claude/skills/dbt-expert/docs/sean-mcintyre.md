Data Vault 2.0 is a data modeling technique designed to help scale large data warehousing projects. It is a rigid, prescriptive system detailed vigorously in [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Scalable-Data-Warehouse-Vault/dp/0128025107) that has become the bible for this technique.

So why Data Vault? Have you experienced a data warehousing project with 50+ data sources, with 25+ data developers working on the same data platform, or data spanning 5+ years with two or more generations of source systems? If not, it might be hard to initially understand the benefits of Data Vault, and maybe [Kimball modelling](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/kimball-dimensional-model) is better for you. But if you are in *any* of the situations listed, then this is the article for you!

Teams thrive when each team member is provided with the tools that best complement and enhance their skills. You wouldn’t hand Cristiano Ronaldo a tennis racket and expect a perfect serve! At Roche, getting the right tools in the hands of our teammates was critical to our ability to grow our data team from 10 core engineers to over 100 contributors in just two years. We embraced both dbt Core and dbt Cloud at Roche (a dbt-squared solution, if you will!) to quickly scale our data platform.
