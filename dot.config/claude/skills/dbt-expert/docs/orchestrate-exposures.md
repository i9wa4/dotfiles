#### Set up and visualize downstream exposures

Set up downstream exposures automatically from dashboards to understand how models are used in downstream tools for a richer downstream lineage.](/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau)

#### Orchestrate downstream exposures

Proactively refreshes the underlying data sources (like Tableau extracts) using the dbt scheduler during scheduled dbt jobs.](/docs/cloud-integrations/orchestrate-exposures)
