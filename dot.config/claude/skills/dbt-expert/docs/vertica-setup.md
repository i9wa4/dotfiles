## Installing dbt-vertica

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations.
Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-vertica`

## Configuring dbt-vertica
