dbt Support Assistant is an AI widget that provides instant, AI-generated responses to common questions. This feature is available to dbt users and can help answer troubleshooting questions, give a synopsis of features and functionality, or link to relevant documentation.

The dbt Support Assistant AI widget is separate from [Copilot](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot), a powerful AI engine that helps with code generation to accelerate your analytics workflows. The dbt Support Assistant focuses on answering documentation and troubleshooting-related questions. Enabling or disabling AI features in dbt won't affect the dbt Support Assistant's availability.
