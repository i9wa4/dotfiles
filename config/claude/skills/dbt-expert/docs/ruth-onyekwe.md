## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

I joined the dbt community in 2021, after meeting dbt Labs reps at a conference. Through partnering with dbt Labs and learning the technology, we (Spaulding Ridge) were able to open a whole new offering in our service catalogue, and meet the growing needs of our customers.

## Which dbt Community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#which-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to Which dbt Community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

I identify with the transparent leaders - those willing to share their learnings, knowledge, and experiences. I want to encourage other dbt enthusiasts to stretch themselves professionally and actively participate in the analytics community.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I've learnt that most of us working in data have experienced the same struggles, be it searching for the best testing frameworks, or deciding how to build optimised and scalable models, or searching for the answers to non-technical questions like how to best organise teams or how to communicate with business stakeholders and translate their needs - we're all faced with the same dilemmas. And the great thing I've learned being in the dbt community, is that if you're brave enough to share your stories, you'll connect with someone who has already gone through those experiences, and can help you reach a solution a lot faster than if you tried to start from scratch.
