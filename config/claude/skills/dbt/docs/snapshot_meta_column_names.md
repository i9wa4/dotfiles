## Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

In order to align with an organization's naming conventions, the `snapshot_meta_column_names` config can be used to customize the names of the [metadata columns](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots#snapshot-meta-fields) within each snapshot.

## Default[​](#default "Direct link to Default")

By default, dbt snapshots use the following column names to track change history using [Type 2 slowly changing dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row) records:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field Meaning  Notes Example|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `dbt_valid_from` The timestamp when this snapshot row was first inserted and became valid. The value is affected by the [`strategy`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/strategy). `snapshot_meta_column_names: {dbt_valid_from: start_date}`| `dbt_valid_to` The timestamp when this row is no longer valid. `snapshot_meta_column_names: {dbt_valid_to: end_date}`| `dbt_scd_id` A unique key generated for each snapshot row. This is used internally by dbt. `snapshot_meta_column_names: {dbt_scd_id: scd_id}`| `dbt_updated_at` The `updated_at` timestamp of the source record when this snapshot row was inserted. This is used internally by dbt. `snapshot_meta_column_names: {dbt_updated_at: modified_date}`| `dbt_is_deleted` A string value indicating if the record has been deleted. (`True` if deleted, `False` if not deleted). Added when `hard_deletes='new_record'` is configured. `snapshot_meta_column_names: {dbt_is_deleted: is_deleted}` | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

All of these column names can be customized using the `snapshot_meta_column_names` config. Refer to the [Example](#example) for more details.

warning

To avoid any unintentional data modification, dbt will **not** automatically apply any column renames. So if a user applies `snapshot_meta_column_names` config for a snapshot without updating the pre-existing table, they will get an error. We recommend either only using these settings for net-new snapshots, or arranging an update of pre-existing tables prior to committing a column name change.

## How [`dbt_scd_id`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snapshot_meta_column_names#default) is calculated[​](#how-dbt_scd_id-is-calculated "Direct link to how-dbt_scd_id-is-calculated")

`dbt_scd_id` is a unique identifier generated for each row in a snapshot. dbt uses this identifier to detect changes in source records and manage versioning in slowly changing dimension (SCD) snapshots.

dbt's snapshot macro handles `dbt_scd_id` in [the dbt-adapters repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/b12c9870d6134905ab09bfda609ce8f81bc4b40a/dbt/include/global_project/macros/materializations/snapshots/strategies.sql#L38).

The hash is computed by concatenating values of the snapshot's [`unique_key`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/unique_key) and either the `updated_at` timestamp (for the timestamp strategy) or the values in `check_cols` (for the check strategy), and then hashing the resulting string using the `md5` function. This enables dbt to track whether the contents of a row have changed between runs.

Here's an example of a custom hash calculation that combines multiple fields into a single string and hashes the result using `md5`.

```
md5(
 coalesce(cast(unique_key1 as string), '') || '|' ||
 coalesce(cast(unique_key2 as string), '') || '|' ||
 coalesce(cast(updated_at as string), '')
)
```

The exact fields included in the hash depend on the snapshot strategy:

* [`timestamp` strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/strategy#use-the-timestamp-strategy): The hash typically combines the [`unique_key`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/unique_key) columns and the `updated_at` value.
* [`check` strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/strategy#use-the-check-strategy): The hash combines the `unique_key` columns and the values of the columns listed in [`check_cols`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/check_cols).

If you don’t want to use `md5`, you can customize the [dispatched macro](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/4b3966efc50b1d013907a88bee4ab8ebd022d17a/dbt-adapters/src/dbt/include/global_project/macros/materializations/snapshots/strategies.sql#L42-L47).

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

snapshots/schema.yml

```
snapshots:
  - name: orders_snapshot
    relation: ref("orders")
    config:
      unique_key: id
      strategy: check
      check_cols: all
      hard_deletes: new_record
      snapshot_meta_column_names:
        dbt_valid_from: start_date
        dbt_valid_to: end_date
        dbt_scd_id: scd_id
        dbt_updated_at: modified_date
        dbt_is_deleted: is_deleted
```

The resulting snapshot table contains the configured meta column names:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id scd\_id modified\_date start\_date end\_date is\_deleted|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1 60a1f1dbdf899a4dd... 2024-10-02 ... 2024-10-02 ... 2024-10-03 ...
