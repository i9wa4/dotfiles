## December 2024[​](#december-2024 "Direct link to December 2024")

* **New**: Saved queries now support [tags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags), which allow you to categorize your resources and filter them. Add tags to your [saved queries](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/saved-queries) in the `semantic_model.yml` file or `dbt_project.yml` file. For example:

  dbt\_project.yml

  ```
  saved-queries:
    jaffle_shop:
      customer_order_metrics:
        +tags: order_metrics
  ```
* **New**: [Dimensions](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) now support the `meta` config property in [dbt Cloud "Latest" release track](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) and from dbt Core 1.9. You can add metadata to your dimensions to provide additional context and information about the dimension. Refer to [meta](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) for more information.
* **New**: [Downstream exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau) are now generally available to dbt Enterprise plans. Downstream exposures integrate natively with Tableau (Power BI coming soon) and auto-generate downstream lineage in dbt Explorer for a richer experience.
* **New**: The Semantic Layer supports Sigma as a [partner integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations), available in Preview. Refer to [Sigma](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/configure-a-dbt-semantic-layer-integration) for more information.
* **New**: The Semantic Layer now supports Azure Single-tenant deployments. Refer to [Set up the Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl) for more information on how to get started.
* **Fix**: Resolved intermittent issues in Single-tenant environments affecting Semantic Layer and query history.
* **Fix**: [The dbt Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) now respects the BigQuery [`execution_project` attribute](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/bigquery-setup#execution-project), including for exports.
* **New**: [Model notifications](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/model-notifications) are now generally available in dbt. These notifications alert model owners through email about any issues encountered by models and tests as soon as they occur while running a job.
* **New**: You can now use your [Azure OpenAI key](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-integrations?ai-integration=azure#ai-integrations) (available in beta) to use dbt features like [Copilot](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) and [Ask dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/snowflake-native-app) . Additionally, you can use your own [OpenAI API key](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-integrations?ai-integration=openai#ai-integrations) or use [dbt Labs-managed OpenAI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-integrations?ai-integration=dbtlabs#ai-integrations) key. Refer to [AI integrations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-integrations#ai-integrations) for more information.
* **New**: The [`hard_deletes`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/hard-deletes) config gives you more control on how to handle deleted rows from the source. Supported options are `ignore` (default), `invalidate` (replaces the legacy `invalidate_hard_deletes=true`), and `new_record`. Note that `new_record` will create a new metadata column in the snapshot table.

## November 2024[​](#november-2024 "Direct link to November 2024")

* **Enhancement**: Data health signals in dbt Explorer are now available for Exposures, providing a quick view of data health while browsing resources. To view trust signal icons, go to dbt Explorer and click **Exposures** under the **Resource** tab. Refer to [Data health signals for resources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/data-health-signals) for more info.
* **Bug**: Identified and fixed an error with Semantic Layer queries that take longer than 10 minutes to complete.
* **Fix**: Job environment variable overrides in credentials are now respected for Exports. Previously, they were ignored.
* **Behavior change**: If you use a custom microbatch macro, set a [`require_batched_execution_for_custom_microbatch_strategy` behavior flag](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#custom-microbatch-strategy) in your `dbt_project.yml` to enable batched execution. If you don't have a custom microbatch macro, you don't need to set this flag as dbt will handle microbatching automatically for any model using the [microbatch strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch#how-microbatch-compares-to-other-incremental-strategies).
* **Enhancement**: For users that have Advanced CI's [compare changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/advanced-ci#compare-changes) feature enabled, you can optimize performance when running comparisons by using custom dbt syntax to customize deferral usage, exclude specific large models (or groups of models with tags), and more. Refer to [Compare changes custom commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/job-commands#compare-changes-custom-commands) for examples of how to customize the comparison command.
* **New**: SQL linting in CI jobs is now generally available in dbt. You can enable SQL linting in your CI jobs, using [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com/), to automatically lint all SQL files in your project as a run step before your CI job builds. SQLFluff linting is available on [dbt release tracks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) and to dbt [Team or Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/) accounts. Refer to [SQL linting](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration#sql-linting) for more information.
* **New**: Use the [`dbt_valid_to_current`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/dbt_valid_to_current) config to set a custom indicator for the value of `dbt_valid_to` in current snapshot records (like a future date). By default, this value is `NULL`. When configured, dbt will use the specified value instead of `NULL` for `dbt_valid_to` for current records in the snapshot table. This feature is available in [the dbt Cloud "Latest" release track](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) (formerly called `Versionless`) and dbt Core v1.9 and later.
* **New**: Use the [`event_time`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/event-time) configuration to specify "at what time did the row occur." This configuration is required for [Incremental microbatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch) and can be added to ensure you're comparing overlapping times in [Advanced CI's compare changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/advanced-ci). Available in [the dbt Cloud "Latest" release track](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) (formerly called `Versionless`) and dbt Core v1.9 and higher.
* **Fix**: This update improves [Semantic Layer Tableau integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/tableau) making query parsing more reliable. Some key fixes include:
  + Error messages for unsupported joins between saved queries and ALL tables.
  + Improved handling of queries when multiple tables are selected in a data source.
  + Fixed a bug when an IN filter contained a lot of values.
  + Better error messaging for queries that can't be parsed correctly.
* **Enhancement**: The Semantic Layer supports creating new credentials for users who don't have permissions to create service tokens. In the **Credentials & service tokens** side panel, the **+Add Service Token** option is unavailable for those users who don't have permission. Instead, the side panel displays a message indicating that the user doesn't have permission to create a service token and should contact their administration. Refer to [Set up Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl) for more details.

* [Python SDK](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-python) is now generally available

* **Behavior change:** [Multi-factor authentication](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/mfa) is now enforced on all users who log in with username and password credentials.
* **Enhancement**: The dbt Semantic Layer JDBC now allows users to paginate `semantic_layer.metrics()` and `semantic_layer.dimensions()` for metrics and dimensions using `page_size` and `page_number` parameters. Refer to [Paginate metadata calls](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc#querying-the-api-for-metric-metadata) for more information.
* **Enhancement**: The dbt Semantic Layer JDBC now allows you to filter your metrics to include only those that contain a specific substring, using the `search` parameter. If no substring is provided, the query returns all metrics. Refer to [Fetch metrics by substring search](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc#querying-the-api-for-metric-metadata) for more information.
* **Fix**: The [Semantic Layer Excel integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/excel) now correctly surfaces errors when a query fails to execute. Previously, it was not clear why a query failed to run.
* **Fix:** Previously, POST requests to the Jobs API with invalid `cron` strings would return HTTP response status code 500s but would update the underlying entity. Now, POST requests to the Jobs API with invalid `cron` strings will result in status code 400s, without the underlying entity being updated.
* **Fix:** Fixed an issue where the `Source` view page in dbt Explorer did not correctly display source freshness status if older than 30 days.
* **Fix:** The UI now indicates when the description of a model is inherited from a catalog comment.

* **New**: The Cloud IDE supports signed commits for Git, available for Enterprise plans. You can sign your Git commits when pushing them to the repository to prevent impersonation and enhance security. Supported Git providers are GitHub and GitLab. Refer to [Git commit signing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/git-commit-signing) for more information.
* **New:** With Mesh, you can now enable bidirectional dependencies across your projects. Previously, dbt enforced dependencies to only go in one direction. dbt checks for cycles across projects and raises errors if any are detected. For details, refer to [Cycle detection](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies#cycle-detection). There's also the [Intro to Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro) guide to help you learn more best practices.
* **New**: The [Semantic Layer Python software development kit](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-python) is now [generally available](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles). It provides users with easy access to the Semantic Layer with Python and enables developers to interact with the Semantic Layer APIs to query metrics/dimensions in downstream tools.
* **Enhancement**: You can now add a description to a singular data test. Use the [`description` property](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/description) to document [singular data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#singular-data-tests). You can also use [docs block](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation#using-docs-blocks) to capture your test description. The enhancement is available now in [the "Latest" release track in dbt Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks), and it will be included in dbt Core v1.9.
* **New**: Introducing the [microbatch incremental model strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch) (beta), available now in [dbt Cloud Latest](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) and will soon be supported in dbt Core v1.9. The microbatch strategy allows for efficient, batch-based processing of large time-series datasets for improved performance and resiliency, especially when you're working with data that changes over time (like new records being added daily). To enable this feature in dbt Cloud, set the `DBT_EXPERIMENTAL_MICROBATCH` environment variable to `true` in your project.
* **New**: The dbt Semantic Layer supports custom calendar configurations in MetricFlow, available in [Preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles#dbt-cloud). Custom calendar configurations allow you to query data using non-standard time periods like `fiscal_year` or `retail_month`. Refer to [custom calendar](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine#custom-calendar) to learn how to define these custom granularities in your MetricFlow timespine YAML configuration.
* **New**: In the "Latest" release track in dbt, [Snapshots](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots) have been updated to use YAML configuration files instead of SQL snapshot blocks. This new feature simplifies snapshot management and improves performance, and will soon be released in dbt Core 1.9.
  + Who does this affect? Users of the "Latest" release track in dbt can define snapshots using the new YAML specification. Users upgrading to "Latest" who have existing snapshot definitions can keep their existing configurations, or they can choose to migrate their snapshot definitions to YAML.
  + Users on older versions: No action is needed; existing snapshots will continue to work as before. However, we recommend upgrading to the "Latest" release track to take advantage of the new snapshot features.
* **Behavior change:** Set [`state_modified_compare_more_unrendered_values`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#source-definitions-for-state) to true to reduce false positives for `state:modified` when configs differ between `dev` and `prod` environments.
* **Behavior change:** Set the [`skip_nodes_if_on_run_start_fails`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#failures-in-on-run-start-hooks) flag to `True` to skip all selected resources from running if there is a failure on an `on-run-start` hook.
* **Enhancement**: In the "Latest" release track in dbt Cloud, snapshots defined in SQL files can now use `config` defined in `schema.yml` YAML files. This update resolves the previous limitation that required snapshot properties to be defined exclusively in `dbt_project.yml` and/or a `config()` block within the SQL file. This will also be released in dbt Core 1.9.
* **New**: In the "Latest" release track in dbt Cloud, the `snapshot_meta_column_names` config allows for customizing the snapshot metadata columns. This feature allows an organization to align these automatically-generated column names with their conventions, and will be included in the upcoming dbt Core 1.9 release.
* **Enhancement**: the "Latest" release track in dbt Cloud infers a model's `primary_key` based on configured data tests and/or constraints within `manifest.json`. The inferred `primary_key` is visible in dbt Explorer and utilized by the dbt Cloud [compare changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/run-visibility#compare-tab) feature. This will also be released in dbt Core 1.9. Read about the [order dbt infers columns can be used as primary key of a model](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/7940ad5c7858ff11ef100260a372f2f06a86e71f/core/dbt/contracts/graph/nodes.py#L534-L541).
* **New:** dbt Explorer now includes trust signal icons, which is currently available as a [Preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles#dbt-cloud). Trust signals offer a quick, at-a-glance view of data health when browsing your dbt models in dbt Explorer. These icons indicate whether a model is **Healthy**, **Caution**, **Degraded**, or **Unknown**. For accurate health data, ensure the resource is up-to-date and has had a recent job run. Refer to [Data health signals](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/data-health-signals) for more information.
* **New:** Downstream exposures are now available in Preview in dbt. Downstream exposures helps users understand how their models are used in downstream analytics tools to inform investments and reduce incidents. It imports and auto-generates exposures based on Tableau dashboards, with user-defined curation. To learn more, refer to [Downstream exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau).

## September 2024[​](#september-2024 "Direct link to September 2024")

* **Fix**: MetricFlow updated `get_and_expire` to replace the unsupported `GETEX` command with a `GET` and conditional expiration, ensuring compatibility with Azure Redis 6.0.
* **Enhancement**: The [dbt Semantic Layer Python SDK](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-python) now supports `TimeGranularity` custom grain for metrics. This feature allows you to define custom time granularities for metrics, such as `fiscal_year` or `retail_month`, to query data using non-standard time periods.
* **New**: Use the Copilot AI engine to generate semantic model for your models, now available in beta. Copilot automatically generates documentation, tests, and now semantic models based on the data in your model, . To learn more, refer to [Copilot](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot).
* **New**: Use the new recommended syntax for [defining `foreign_key` constraints](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/constraints) using `refs`, available in the "Latest" release track in dbt Cloud. This will soon be released in dbt Core v1.9. This new syntax will capture dependencies and works across different environments.
* **Enhancement**: You can now run [Semantic Layer commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands) commands in the [dbt Cloud IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio). The supported commands are `dbt sl list`, `dbt sl list metrics`, `dbt sl list dimension-values`, `dbt sl list saved-queries`, `dbt sl query`, `dbt sl list dimensions`, `dbt sl list entities`, and `dbt sl validate`.
* **New**: Microsoft Excel, a Semantic Layer integration, is now generally available. The integration allows you to connect to Microsoft Excel to query metrics and collaborate with your team. Available for [Excel Desktop](https://pages.store.office.com/addinsinstallpage.aspx?assetid=WA200007100&rs=en-US&correlationId=4132ecd1-425d-982d-efb4-de94ebc83f26) or [Excel Online](https://pages.store.office.com/addinsinstallpage.aspx?assetid=WA200007100&rs=en-US&correlationid=4132ecd1-425d-982d-efb4-de94ebc83f26&isWac=True). For more information, refer to [Microsoft Excel](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/excel).
* **New**: [Data health tile](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/data-tile) is now generally available in dbt Explorer. Data health tiles provide a quick at-a-glance view of your data quality, highlighting potential issues in your data. You can embed these tiles in your dashboards to quickly identify and address data quality issues in your dbt project.
* **New**: dbt Explorer's Model query history feature is now in Preview for dbt Enterprise customers. Model query history allows you to view the count of consumption queries for a model based on the data warehouse's query logs. This feature provides data teams insight, so they can focus their time and infrastructure spend on the worthwhile used data products. To learn more, refer to [Model query history](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/model-query-history).
* **Enhancement**: You can now use [Extended Attributes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) and [Environment Variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables) when connecting to the Semantic Layer. If you set a value directly in the Semantic Layer Credentials, it will have a higher priority than Extended Attributes. When using environment variables, the default value for the environment will be used. If you're using exports, job environment variable overrides aren't supported yet, but they will be soon.
* **New:** There are two new [environment variable defaults](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables#dbt-cloud-context) — `DBT_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` and `DBT_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`.
* **New:** The [Amazon Athena warehouse connection](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-amazon-athena) is available as a public preview for dbt accounts that have upgraded to [the "Latest" release track](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks).

## August 2024[​](#august-2024 "Direct link to August 2024")

* **Fix:** Fixed an issue in [dbt Explorer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects) where navigating to a consumer project from a public node resulted in displaying a random public model rather than the original selection.
* **New**: You can now configure metrics at granularities at finer time grains, such as hour, minute, or even by the second. This is particularly useful for more detailed analysis and for datasets where high-resolution time data is required, such as minute-by-minute event tracking. Refer to [dimensions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dimensions) for more information about time granularity.
* **Enhancement**: Microsoft Excel now supports [saved selections](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/excel#using-saved-selections) and [saved queries](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/excel#using-saved-queries). Use Saved selections to save your query selections within the Excel application. The application also clears stale data in [trailing rows](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/excel#other-settings) by default. To return your results and keep any previously selected data intact, un-select the **Clear trailing rows** option.
* **Behavior change:** GitHub is no longer supported for OAuth login to dbt. Use a supported [SSO or OAuth provider](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) to securely manage access to your dbt account.

## July 2024[​](#july-2024 "Direct link to July 2024")

* **Behavior change:** `target_schema` is no longer a required configuration for [snapshots](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots). You can now target different schemas for snapshots across development and deployment environments using the [schema config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/schema).
* **New:** [Connections](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections#connection-management) are now available under **Account settings** as a global setting. Previously, they were found under **Project settings**. This is being rolled out in phases over the coming weeks.
* **New:** Admins can now assign [environment-level permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/environment-permissions) to groups for specific roles.
* **New:** [Merge jobs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/merge-jobs) for implementing [continuous deployment (CD)](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-deployment) workflows are now GA in dbt. Previously, you had to either set up a custom GitHub action or manually build the changes every time a pull request is merged.
* **New**: The ability to lint your SQL files from the dbt CLI is now available. To learn more, refer to [Lint SQL files](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli#lint-sql-files).
* **Behavior change:** dbt Cloud IDE automatically adds a `--limit 100` to preview queries to avoid slow and expensive queries during development. Recently, dbt Core changed how the `limit` is applied to ensure that `order by` clauses are consistently respected. Because of this, queries that already contain a limit clause might now cause errors in the IDE previews. To address this, dbt Labs plans to provide an option soon to disable the limit from being applied. Until then, dbt Labs recommends removing the (duplicate) limit clause from your queries during previews to avoid these IDE errors.
* **Enhancement**: Introducing a revamped overview page for dbt Explorer, available in beta. It includes a new design and layout for the dbt Explorer homepage. The new layout provides a more intuitive experience for users to navigate their dbt projects, as well as a new **Latest updates** section to view the latest changes or issues related to project resources. To learn more, refer to [Overview page](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects#overview-page).

#### dbt Semantic Layer[​](#dbt-semantic-layer "Direct link to dbt Semantic Layer")

* **New**: Introduced the [`dbt-sl-sdk` Python software development kit (SDK)](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python) Python library, which provides you with easy access to the dbt Semantic Layer with Python. It allows developers to interact with the dbt Semantic Layer APIs and query metrics and dimensions in downstream tools. Refer to the [dbt Semantic Layer Python SDK](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-python) for more information.
* **New**: Introduced Semantic validations in CI pipelines. Automatically test your semantic nodes (metrics, semantic models, and saved queries) during code reviews by adding warehouse validation checks in your CI job using the `dbt sl validate` command. You can also validate modified semantic nodes to guarantee code changes made to dbt models don't break these metrics. Refer to [Semantic validations in CI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs#semantic-validations-in-ci) to learn about the additional commands and use cases.
* **New**: We now expose the `meta` field within the [config property](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) for dbt Semantic Layer metrics in the [JDBC and GraphQL APIs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview) under the `meta` field.
* **New**: Added a new command in the dbt CLI called `export-all`, which allows you to export multiple or all of your saved queries. Previously, you had to explicitly specify the [list of saved queries](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands#list-saved-queries).
* **Enhancement**: The Semantic Layer now offers more granular control by supporting multiple data platform credentials, which can represent different roles or service accounts. Available for dbt Enterprise plans, you can map credentials to service tokens for secure authentication. Refer to [Set up Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl#set-up-dbt-semantic-layer) for more details.
* **Fix**: Addressed a bug where unicode query filters (such as Chinese characters) were not working correctly in the Semantic Layer Tableau integration.
* **Fix**: Resolved a bug with parsing certain private keys for BigQuery when running an export.
* **Fix**: Addressed a bug that caused a "closed connection" error to be returned when querying or running an Export.
* **Fix**: Resolved an issue in dbt Core where, during partial parsing, all generated metrics in a file were incorrectly deleted instead of just those related to the changed semantic model. Now, only the metrics associated with the modified model are affected.

## June 2024[​](#june-2024 "Direct link to June 2024")

* **New:** Introduced new granularity support for cumulative metrics in MetricFlow. Granularity options for cumulative metrics are slightly different than granularity for other metric types. For other metrics, we use the `date_trunc` function to implement granularity. However, because cumulative metrics are non-additive (values can't be added up), we can't use the `date_trunc` function to change their time grain granularity.

  Instead, we use the `first()`, `last()`, and `avg()` aggregation functions to aggregate cumulative metrics over the requested period. By default, we take the first value of the period. You can change this behavior by using the `period_agg` parameter. For more information, refer to [Granularity options for cumulative metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/cumulative#granularity-options).

#### dbt Semantic Layer[​](#dbt-semantic-layer-1 "Direct link to dbt Semantic Layer")

* **New:** Added support for Predicate pushdown SQL optimization in MetricFlow. We will now push down categorical dimension filters to the metric source table. Previously filters were applied after we selected from the metric source table. This change helps reduce full table scans on certain query engines.
* **New:** Enabled `where` filters on dimensions (included in saved queries) to use the cache during query time. This means you can now dynamically filter your dashboards without losing the performance benefits of caching. Refer to [caching](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/sl-cache#result-caching) for more information.
* **Enhancement:** In [Google Sheets](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets), we added information icons and descriptions to metrics and dimensions options in the Query Builder menu. Click on the **Info** icon button to view a description of the metric or dimension. Available in the following Query Builder menu sections: metric, group by, where, saved selections, and saved queries.
* **Enhancement:** In [Google Sheets](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets), you can now apply granularity to all time dimensions, not just metric time. This update uses our [APIs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview) to support granularity selection on any chosen time dimension.
* **Enhancement**: MetricFlow time spine warnings now prompt users to configure missing or small-grain-time spines. An error message is displayed for multiple time spines per granularity.
* **Enhancement**: Errors now display if no time spine is configured at the requested or smaller granularity.
* **Enhancement:** Improved querying error message when no semantic layer credentials were set.
* **Enhancement:** Querying grains for cumulative metrics now returns multiple granularity options (day, week, month, quarter, year) like all other metric types. Previously, you could only query one grain option for cumulative metrics.
* **Fix:** Removed errors that prevented querying cumulative metrics with other granularities.
* **Fix:** Fixed various Tableau errors when querying certain metrics or when using calculated fields.
* **Fix:** In Tableau, we relaxed naming field expectations to better identify calculated fields.
* **Fix:** Fixed an error when refreshing database metadata for columns that we can't convert to Arrow. These columns will now be skipped. This mainly affected Redshift users with custom types.
* **Fix:** Fixed Private Link connections for Databricks.

#### Also available this month:[​](#also-available-this-month "Direct link to Also available this month:")

* **Enhancement:** Updates to the UI when [creating merge jobs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/merge-jobs) are now available. The updates include improvements to helper text, new deferral settings, and performance improvements.

* **New:** [Job warnings](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/job-notifications) are now GA. Previously, you could receive email or Slack alerts about your jobs when they succeeded, failed, or were canceled. Now with the new **Warns** option, you can also receive alerts when jobs have encountered warnings from tests or source freshness checks during their run. This gives you more flexibility on *when* to be notified.
* **New:** A [preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles#dbt-cloud) of the dbt Snowflake Native App is now available.

These first-class integrations allow you to query and unlock valuable insights from your data ecosystem.
* **Enhancement:** As part of our ongoing commitment to improving the [IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio#considerations), the filesystem now comes with improvements to speed up dbt development, such as introducing a Git repository limit of 10GB.

#### Also available this month:[​](#also-available-this-month-1 "Direct link to Also available this month:")

* **Update**: The [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) is now available for Azure single tenant and is accessible in all [deployment regions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses) for both multi-tenant and single-tenant accounts.
* **New**: The [Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) introduces [declarative caching](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/sl-cache), allowing you to cache common queries to speed up performance and reduce query compute costs. Available for dbt Team or Enterprise accounts.
* New: Latest Release Track

  The **Latest** Release Track is now Generally Available (previously Public Preview).

  On this release track, you get automatic upgrades of dbt, including early access to the latest features, fixes, and performance improvements for your dbt project. dbt Labs will handle upgrades behind-the-scenes, as part of testing and redeploying the dbt Cloud application — just like other dbt Cloud capabilities and other SaaS tools that you're using. No more manual upgrades and no more need for *a second sandbox project* just to try out new features in development.

  To learn more about the new setting, refer to [Release Tracks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) for details.

  [![Example of the Latest setting](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/choosing-dbt-version/example-environment-settings.png?v=2 "Example of the Latest setting")](#)Example of the Latest setting
* **Behavior change:** Introduced the `require_resource_names_without_spaces` flag, opt-in and disabled by default. If set to `True`, dbt will raise an exception if it finds a resource name containing a space in your project or an installed package. This will become the default in a future version of dbt. Read [No spaces in resource names](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#no-spaces-in-resource-names) for more information.

## April 2024[​](#april-2024 "Direct link to April 2024")

* New: Merge jobs[Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

  You can now set up a continuous deployment (CD) workflow for your projects natively in dbt Cloud. You can now access a beta release of [Merge jobs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/merge-jobs), which is a new [job type](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/jobs), that enables you to trigger dbt job runs as soon as changes (via Git pull requests) merge into production.

  [![Example of creating a merge job](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/example-create-merge-job.png?v=2 "Example of creating a merge job")](#)Example of creating a merge job
* **Behavior change:** Introduced the `require_explicit_package_overrides_for_builtin_materializations` flag, opt-in and disabled by default. If set to `True`, dbt will only use built-in materializations defined in the root project or within dbt, rather than implementations in packages. This will become the default in May 2024 (dbt Core v1.8 and dbt Cloud release tracks). Read [Package override for built-in materialization](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#package-override-for-built-in-materialization) for more information.

**Semantic Layer**

* **New**: Use Saved selections to [save your query selections](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets#using-saved-selections) within the [Google Sheets application](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets). They can be made private or public and refresh upon loading.
* **New**: Metrics are now displayed by their labels as `metric_name`.
* **Enhancement**: [Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview) now supports the [`meta` option](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) under the [config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/config) property. Previously, we only supported the now deprecated `meta` tag.
* **Enhancement**: In the Google Sheets application, we added [support](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets#using-saved-queries) to allow jumping off from or exploring MetricFlow-defined saved queries directly.
* **Enhancement**: In the Google Sheets application, we added support to query dimensions without metrics. Previously, you needed a dimension.
* **Enhancement**: In the Google Sheets application, we added support for time presets and complex time range filters such as "between", "after", and "before".
* **Enhancement**: In the Google Sheets application, we added supported to automatically populate dimension values when you select a "where" filter, removing the need to manually type them. Previously, you needed to manually type the dimension values.
* **Enhancement**: In the Google Sheets application, we added support to directly query entities, expanding the flexibility of data requests.
* **Enhancement**: In the Google Sheets application, we added an option to exclude column headers, which is useful for populating templates with only the required data.
* **Deprecation**: For the Tableau integration, the [`METRICS_AND_DIMENSIONS` data source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/tableau#using-the-integration) has been deprecated for all accounts not actively using it. We encourage users to transition to the "ALL" data source for future integrations.

## March 2024[​](#march-2024 "Direct link to March 2024")

* **New:** The Semantic Layer services now support using Privatelink for customers who have it enabled.
* **New:** You can now develop against and test your Semantic Layer in the dbt CLI if your developer credential uses SSO.
* **Enhancement:** You can select entities to Group By, Filter By, and Order By.
* **Fix:** `dbt parse` no longer shows an error when you use a list of filters (instead of just a string filter) on a metric.
* **Fix:** `join_to_timespine` now properly gets applied to conversion metric input measures.
* **Fix:** Fixed an issue where exports in Redshift were not always committing to the DWH, which also had the side-effect of leaving table locks open.
* **Behavior change:** Introduced the `source_freshness_run_project_hooks` flag, opt-in and disabled by default. If set to `True`, dbt will include `on-run-*` project hooks in the `source freshness` command. This will become the default in a future version of dbt. Read [Project hooks with source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#project-hooks-with-source-freshness) for more information.

## February 2024[​](#february-2024 "Direct link to February 2024")

* **New:** [Exports](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/exports#define-exports) allow you to materialize a saved query as a table or view in your data platform. By using exports, you can unify metric definitions in your data platform and query them as you would any other table or view.
* **New:** You can access a list of your [exports](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/exports) with the new list saved-queries command by adding `--show-exports`
* **New:** The Semantic Layer and [Tableau Connector](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/tableau) now supports relative date filters in Tableau.
* New: Use exports to write saved queries

  You can now use the [exports](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/exports) feature with [dbt Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), allowing you to query reliable metrics and fast data reporting. Exports enhance the saved queries feature, allowing you to write commonly used queries directly within your data platform using dbt Cloud's job scheduler.

  By exposing tables of metrics and dimensions, exports enable you to integrate with additional tools that don't natively connect with the dbt Semantic Layer, such as PowerBI.

  Exports are available for dbt Cloud multi-tenant [Team or Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/) plans on dbt versions 1.7 or newer. Refer to the [exports blog](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/announcing-exports-for-the-dbt-semantic-layer) for more details.

  [![Add an environment variable to run exports in your production run.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/deploy_exports.png?v=2 "Add an environment variable to run exports in your production run.")](#)Add an environment variable to run exports in your production run.
* New: Trigger on job completion teamenterprise

  Now available for dbt Cloud Team and Enterprise plans is the ability to trigger deploy jobs when other deploy jobs are complete. You can enable this feature [in the UI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs) with the **Run when another job finishes** option in the **Triggers** section of your job or with the [Create Job API endpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v2#/operations/Create%20Job).

  When enabled, your job will run after the specified upstream job completes. You can configure which run status(es) will trigger your job. It can be just on `Success` or on all statuses. If you have dependencies between your dbt projects, this allows you to *natively* orchestrate your jobs within dbt Cloud — no need to set up a third-party tool.

  An example of the **Triggers** section when creating the job:

* New: Latest Release Track[Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

  *Now available in the dbt version dropdown in dbt Cloud — starting with select customers, rolling out to wider availability through February and March.*

  On this release track, you get automatic upgrades of dbt, including early access to the latest features, fixes, and performance improvements for your dbt project. dbt Labs will handle upgrades behind-the-scenes, as part of testing and redeploying the dbt Cloud application — just like other dbt Cloud capabilities and other SaaS tools that you're using. No more manual upgrades and no more need for *a second sandbox project* just to try out new features in development.

* New: Override dbt version with new User development settings

  You can now [override the dbt version](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#override-dbt-version) that's configured for the development environment within your project and use a different version — affecting only your user account. This lets you test new dbt features without impacting other people working on the same project. And when you're satisfied with the test results, you can safely upgrade the dbt version for your project(s).

  Use the **dbt version** dropdown to specify the version to override with. It's available on your project's credentials page in the **User development settings** section. For example:

  [![Example of overriding the dbt version on your user account](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/choosing-dbt-version/example-override-version.png?v=2 "Example of overriding the dbt version on your user account")](#)Example of overriding the dbt version on your user account
* Enhancement: Edit in primary git branch in IDE

  You can now edit, format, or lint files and execute dbt commands directly in your primary git branch in the [dbt Cloud IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio). This enhancement is available across various repositories, including native integrations, imported git URLs, and managed repos.

  This enhancement is currently available to all dbt Cloud multi-tenant regions and will soon be available to single-tenant accounts.

  The primary branch of the connected git repo has traditionally been *read-only* in the IDE. This update changes the branch to *protected* and allows direct edits. When a commit is made, dbt Cloud will prompt you to create a new branch. dbt Cloud will pre-populate the new branch name with the GIT\_USERNAME-patch-#; however, you can edit the field with a custom branch name.

  Previously, the primary branch was displayed as read-only, but now the branch is displayed with a lock icon to identify it as protected:

  [![Previous read-only experience](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/read-only.png?v=2 "Previous read-only experience")](#)Previous read-only experience

  [![New protected experience](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/protected.png?v=2 "New protected experience")](#)New protected experience

  When you make a commit while on the primary branch, a modal window will open prompting you to create a new branch and enter a commit message:

  [![Create new branch window](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/create-new-branch.png?v=2 "Create new branch window")](#)Create new branch window
* **Enhancement:** The Semantic Layer [Google Sheets integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets) now exposes a note on the cell where the data was requested, indicating clearer data requests. The integration also now exposes a new **Time Range** option, which allows you to quickly select date ranges.
* **Enhancement:** The [GraphQL API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql) includes a `requiresMetricTime` parameter to better handle metrics that must be grouped by time. (Certain metrics defined in MetricFlow can't be looked at without a time dimension).
* **Enhancement:** Enable querying metrics with offset and cumulative metrics with the time dimension name, instead of `metric_time`. [Issue #1000](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1000)

  + Enable querying `metric_time` without metrics. [Issue #928](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/928)
* **Enhancement:** Added support for consistent SQL query generation, which enables ID generation consistency between otherwise identical MF queries. Previously, the SQL generated by `MetricFlowEngine` was not completely consistent between identical queries. [Issue 1020](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1020)
* **Fix:** The Tableau Connector returns a date filter when filtering by dates. Previously it was erroneously returning a timestamp filter.
* **Fix:** MetricFlow now validates if there are `metrics`, `group by`, or `saved_query` items in each query. Previously, there was no validation. [Issue 1002](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1002)
* **Fix:** Measures using `join_to_timespine` in MetricFlow now have filters applied correctly after time spine join.
* **Fix:** Querying multiple granularities with offset metrics:

  + If you query a time offset metric with multiple instances of `metric_time`/`agg_time_dimension`, only one of the instances will be offset. All of them should be.
  + If you query a time offset metric with one instance of `metric_time`/`agg_time_dimension` but filter by a different one, the query will fail.
* **Fix:** MetricFlow prioritizes a candidate join type over the default type when evaluating nodes to join. For example, the default join type for distinct values queries is `FULL OUTER JOIN`, however, time spine joins require `CROSS JOIN`, which is more appropriate.
* **Fix:** Fixed a bug that previously caused errors when entities were referenced in `where` filters.

* **New:** New metric type that allows you to measure conversion events. For example, users who viewed a web page and then filled out a form. For more details, refer to [Conversion metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/conversion).
* **New:** Instead of specifying the fully qualified dimension name (for example, `order__user__country`) in the group by or filter expression, you now only need to provide the primary entity and dimensions name, like `user__county`.
* **New:** You can now query the [saved queries](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/saved-queries) you've defined in the Semantic Layer using [Tableau](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/tableau), [GraphQL API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql), [JDBC API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc), and the [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation).
* New: Native support for partial parsing

  By default, dbt parses all the files in your project at the beginning of every dbt invocation. Depending on the size of your project, this operation can take a long time to complete. With the new partial parsing feature in dbt Cloud, you can reduce the time it takes for dbt to parse your project. When enabled, dbt Cloud parses only the changed files in your project instead of parsing all the project files. As a result, your dbt invocations will take less time to run.

  To learn more, refer to [Partial parsing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-settings#partial-parsing).

* **Enhancement:** The YAML spec parameter `label` is now available for Semantic Layer metrics in [JDBC and GraphQL APIs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview). This means you can conveniently use `label` as a display name for your metrics when exposing them.
* **Enhancement:** Added support for `create_metric: true` for a measure, which is a shorthand to quickly create metrics. This is useful in cases when metrics are only used to build other metrics.
* **Enhancement:** Added support for Tableau parameter filters. You can use the [Tableau connector](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/tableau) to create and use parameters with your Semantic Layer data.
* **Enhancement:** Added support to expose `expr` and `agg` for [Measures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/measures) in the [GraphQL API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql).
* **Enhancement:** You have improved error messages in the command line interface when querying a dimension that is not reachable for a given metric.
* **Enhancement:** You can now query entities using our Tableau integration (similar to querying dimensions).
* **Enhancement:** A new data source is available in our Tableau integration called "ALL", which contains all semantic objects defined. This has the same information as "METRICS\_AND\_DIMENSIONS". In the future, we will deprecate "METRICS\_AND\_DIMENSIONS" in favor of "ALL" for clarity.
* **Fix:** Support for numeric types with precision greater than 38 (like `BIGDECIMAL`) in BigQuery is now available. Previously, it was unsupported so would return an error.
* **Fix:** In some instances, large numeric dimensions were being interpreted by Tableau in scientific notation, making them hard to use. These should now be displayed as numbers as expected.
* **Fix:** We now preserve dimension values accurately instead of being inadvertently converted into strings.
* **Fix:** Resolved issues with naming collisions in queries involving multiple derived metrics using the same metric input. Previously, this could cause a naming collision. Input metrics are now deduplicated, ensuring each is referenced only once.
* **Fix:** Resolved warnings related to using two duplicate input measures in a derived metric. Previously, this would trigger a warning. Input measures are now deduplicated, enhancing query processing and clarity.
* **Fix:** Resolved an error where referencing an entity in a filter using the object syntax would fail. For example, `{{Entity('entity_name')}}` would fail to resolve.
