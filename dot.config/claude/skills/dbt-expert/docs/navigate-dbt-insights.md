Learn how to navigate Insights interface and use the main components.

Insights provides an interactive interface for writing, running, and analyzing SQL queries. This section highlights the main components of Insights.

## Query console[​](#query-console "Direct link to Query console")

The query console is the main component of Insights. It allows you to write, run, and analyze SQL queries. The Query console supports:

1. Query console editor, which allows you to write, run, and analyze SQL queries:

* It supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete suggestions
* Hyperlink from SQL code `ref` to the corresponding Explorer page

2. [Query console menu](#query-console-menu), which contains **Bookmark (icon)**, **Develop**, and **Run** buttons.
3. [Query output panel](#query-output-panel), below the query editor and displays the results of a query:

* Has three tabs: **Data**, **Chart**, and **Details**, which allow you to analyze query execution and visualize results.

4. [Query console sidebar menu](#query-console-sidebar-menu), which contains the **Catalog**, **Bookmark**, **Query history**, and **Copilot** icons.

### Query console menu[​](#query-console-menu "Direct link to Query console menu")

The Query console menu is located at the top right of the Query editor. It contains the **Bookmark**, **Develop**, and **Run** buttons:

* **Bookmark** button — Save your frequently used SQL queries as favorites for easier access.
  + When you click **Bookmark**, a **Bookmark Query Details** modal (pop up box) will appear where you can add a **Title** and **Description**.
  + Let [Copilot](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) do the writing for you — use the AI assistant to automatically generate a helpful description for your bookmark.
  + Access the newly created bookmark from the **Bookmark** icon in the [Query console sidebar menu](#query-console-sidebar-menu).
* **Develop**: Open the [Studio IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio) or [Canvas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/canvas) to continue editing your SQL query.
* **Run** button — Run your SQL query and view the results in the **Data** tab.

## Query Builder [Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")[​](#query-builder- "Direct link to query-builder-")

Query Builder in dbt Insights lets you build queries against the Semantic Layer without writing SQL code. It guides you in creating queries based on available metrics, dimensions, and entities. With Query Builder, you can:

* Build analyses from your predefined semantic layer metrics.
* Have filters, time ranges, and aggregates tailored to the semantic model.
* View the underlying SQL code for each metric query.

To create a query in Query Builder:

1. From the main menu, go to **Insights**.
2. Click **Build a query**.
3. Select what you want to include in your query.

   * Click **Add Metric** to select the metrics for your query.
   * Click **Add Group by** to choose the dimensions that break down your metric, such as time grain (day, week, month), region, product, or customer.
   * Click **Add Filter** to create a filter to narrow your results.
   * Click **Add Order by** to select how you want to sort the results of your query.
   * Click **Add Limit**, select the amount of results you want to see when you run your query. If left blank, you will get all the results.
4. Click **Run** to run your query.
   Results are available in the **Data** tab. You can see the SQL code generated in the **Details** tab.

## Query output panel[​](#query-output-panel "Direct link to Query output panel")

The Query output panel is below the query editor and displays the results of a query. It displays the following tabs to analyze query execution and visualize results:

* **Data** tab — Preview your SQL results, with results paginated.
* **Details** tab — Generates succinct details of executed SQL query:
  + Query metadata — Copilot's AI-generated title and description. Along with the supplied SQL and compiled SQL.
  + Connection details — Relevant data platform connection information.
  + Query details — Query duration, status, column count, row count.
* **Chart** tab — Visualizes query results with built-in charts.
  + Use the chart icon to select the type of chart you want to visualize your results. Available chart types are **line chart, bar chart, or scatterplot**.
  + Use the **Chart settings** to customize the chart type and the columns you want to visualize.
  + Available chart types are **line chart, bar chart, or scatterplot**.
* **Download** button — Allows you to export the results to CSV

### dbt Copilot[​](#dbt-copilot "Direct link to dbt Copilot")

Use [dbt Copilot's AI assistant](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) to modify or generate queries using natural language prompts or to chat with the Analyst agent to gather insights about your data. There are two ways you can use dbt Copilot in Insights to interact with your data:

[![dbt Copilot in Insights](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-insights/insights-copilot-tabs.png?v=2 "dbt Copilot in Insights")](#)dbt Copilot in Insights

* **Agent** tab[Private beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles") - Ask questions to the Analyst agent to get intelligent data analysis with automated workflows, governed insights, and actionable recommendations. This is a conversational AI feature where you can ask natural language prompts and receive analysis in real-time. To request access to the Analyst agent, [join the waitlist](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-agents#dbt-Agents-signup).

  Some sample questions you can ask the agent:

  + *What region are my sales growing the fastest?*
  + *What was the revenue last month?*
  + *How should I optimize my marketing spend next quarter?*
  + *How many customers do I have, broken down by customer type?*

  The Analyst agent creates an analysis plan based on your question. The agent:

  1. Gets context using your semantic models and metrics.
  2. Generates SQL queries using your project's definitions.
  3. Executes the SQL query and returns results with context.
  4. Reviews and summarizes the generated insights and provides a comprehensive answer.

  The agent can loop through these steps multiple times if it hasn't reached a complete answer, allowing for complex, multi-step analysis.⁠

  For more information, see [Analyze data with the Analyst agent](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/use-dbt-copilot#analyze-data-with-the-analyst-agent).
* **Generate SQL** tab - Build queries in Insights with natural language prompts to explore and query data with an intuitive, context-rich interface. For more information, see [Build queries](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/use-dbt-copilot#build-queries).
