## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

I joined dbt Slack on November 2022. It was the time our company decided to use dbt in our data architecture, so I joined the #local-taipei channel in [dbt Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community) and introduced myself. To my surprise, I was immediately invited to share my experience at a [Taipei dbt Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/taipei-dbt-meetup/). I just joined the community, never joined any other meetups, did not know anyone there, and was very new to dbt.

The biggest impact to my career is that I gained a lot of visibility! I got to know a lot of great data people, and now I have one [meetup presentation recorded on YouTube](https://youtu.be/KWfoT1nnexc?t=291), 30 technical articles on iThome Iron Man Contest, and now I am featured in the dbt Community Spotlight!

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#what-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

Karen Hsieh is the best! She not only brought me in to the dbt Community by way of the #local-taipei channel in dbt Slack, but she also encouraged me to contribute to the community in many ways, without making me feel pressured. With her passion and leading style, Karen successfully built a friendly and diverse group of people in #local-taipei.

I’d also like to recommend [Bruno de Lima](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/spotlight/bruno-de-lima)'s LinkedIn posts. His 'dbt Tips of the Day' effectively delivery knowledge in a user-friendly way. In addition, I really enjoyed the dbt exam practice polls. Learning dbt can be a challenge, but Bruno makes it both easy and fun!

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I learned that there are many ways to contribute to the community, regardless of our background or skill level. Everyone has something valuable to offer, and we should never be afraid to share. Let's find our own ways to make an impact!

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?[​](#anything-else-interesting-you-want-to-tell-us "Direct link to Anything else interesting you want to tell us?")

Although the #local-taipei channel in dbt Slack is not made up of many, many people, we still managed to assemble a team of 7 people to join the Iron Man Contest. We produced a total of 200 articles in 30 days in topics around dbt and data. I don’t know how many people will find them useful, but it's definitely a great start to raising awareness of dbt in Taiwan.
