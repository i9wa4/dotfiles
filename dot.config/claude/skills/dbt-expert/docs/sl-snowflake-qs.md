## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

The [Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), powered by [MetricFlow](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow), simplifies the setup of key business metrics. It centralizes definitions, avoids duplicate code, and ensures easy access to metrics in downstream tools. MetricFlow helps manage company metrics easier, allowing you to define metrics in your dbt project and query them in dbt with [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands).

📹 Learn about the dbt Semantic Layer with on-demand video courses!

Explore our [dbt Semantic Layer on-demand course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/semantic-layer) to learn how to define and query metrics in your dbt project.

Additionally, dive into mini-courses for querying the dbt Semantic Layer in your favorite tools: [Tableau](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/tableau-querying-the-semantic-layer), [Excel](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/querying-the-semantic-layer-with-excel), [Hex](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/hex-querying-the-semantic-layer), and [Mode](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/mode-querying-the-semantic-layer).

This quickstart guide is designed for dbt users using Snowflake as their data platform. It focuses on building and defining metrics, setting up the Semantic Layer in a dbt project, and querying metrics in Google Sheets.

If you're on different data platforms, you can also follow this guide and will need to modify the setup for the specific platform. See the [users on different platforms](#for-users-on-different-data-platforms) section for more information.

## Create new Snowflake worksheet and set up environment[​](#create-new-snowflake-worksheet-and-set-up-environment "Direct link to Create new Snowflake worksheet and set up environment")

1. Log in to your [trial Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com).
2. In the Snowflake user interface (UI), click **+ Worksheet** in the upper right corner.
3. Select **SQL Worksheet** to create a new worksheet.

### Set up and load data into Snowflake[​](#set-up-and-load-data-into-snowflake "Direct link to Set up and load data into Snowflake")

The data used here is stored as CSV files in a public S3 bucket and the following steps will guide you through how to prepare your Snowflake account for that data and upload it.

1. Create a new virtual warehouse, two new databases (one for raw data, the other for future dbt development), and two new schemas (one for `jaffle_shop` data, the other for `stripe` data).

   To do this, run these SQL commands by typing them into the Editor of your new Snowflake worksheet and clicking **Run** in the upper right corner of the UI:

   ```
   create warehouse transforming;
   create database raw;
   create database analytics;
   create schema raw.jaffle_shop;
   create schema raw.stripe;
   ```
2. In the `raw` database and `jaffle_shop` and `stripe` schemas, create three tables and load relevant data into them:

   * First, delete all contents (empty) in the Editor of the Snowflake worksheet. Then, run this SQL command to create the `customer` table:

     ```
     create table raw.jaffle_shop.customers
     ( id integer,
       first_name varchar,
       last_name varchar
     );
     ```
   * Delete all contents in the Editor, then run this command to load data into the `customer` table:

     ```
     copy into raw.jaffle_shop.customers (id, first_name, last_name)
     from 's3://dbt-tutorial-public/jaffle_shop_customers.csv'
     file_format = (
         type = 'CSV'
         field_delimiter = ','
         skip_header = 1
         );
     ```
   * Delete all contents in the Editor (empty), then run this command to create the `orders` table:

     ```
     create table raw.jaffle_shop.orders
     ( id integer,
       user_id integer,
       order_date date,
       status varchar,
       _etl_loaded_at timestamp default current_timestamp
     );
     ```
   * Delete all contents in the Editor, then run this command to load data into the `orders` table:

     ```
     copy into raw.jaffle_shop.orders (id, user_id, order_date, status)
     from 's3://dbt-tutorial-public/jaffle_shop_orders.csv'
     file_format = (
         type = 'CSV'
         field_delimiter = ','
         skip_header = 1
         );
     ```
   * Delete all contents in the Editor (empty), then run this command to create the `payment` table:

     ```
     create table raw.stripe.payment
     ( id integer,
       orderid integer,
       paymentmethod varchar,
       status varchar,
       amount integer,
       created date,
       _batched_at timestamp default current_timestamp
     );
     ```
   * Delete all contents in the Editor, then run this command to load data into the `payment` table:

     ```
     copy into raw.stripe.payment (id, orderid, paymentmethod, status, amount, created)
     from 's3://dbt-tutorial-public/stripe_payments.csv'
     file_format = (
         type = 'CSV'
         field_delimiter = ','
         skip_header = 1
         );
     ```
3. Verify that the data is loaded by running these SQL queries. Confirm that you can see output for each one.

   ```
   select * from raw.jaffle_shop.customers;
   select * from raw.jaffle_shop.orders;
   select * from raw.stripe.payment;
   ```

## Connect dbt to Snowflake[​](#connect-dbt-to-snowflake "Direct link to Connect dbt to Snowflake")

There are two ways to connect dbt to Snowflake. The first option is Partner Connect, which provides a streamlined setup to create your dbt account from within your new Snowflake trial account. The second option is to create your dbt account separately and build the Snowflake connection yourself (connect manually). If you want to get started quickly, dbt Labs recommends using Partner Connect. If you want to customize your setup from the very beginning and gain familiarity with the dbt setup flow, dbt Labs recommends connecting manually.

* Use Partner Connect* Connect manually

Using Partner Connect allows you to create a complete dbt account with your [Snowflake connection](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-snowflake), [a managed repository](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository), [environments](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas#managing-environments), and credentials.

1. In the Snowflake UI, click on the home icon in the upper left corner. In the left sidebar, select **Data Products**. Then, select **Partner Connect**. Find the dbt tile by scrolling or by searching for dbt in the search bar. Click the tile to connect to dbt.

   [![Snowflake Partner Connect Box](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/snowflake_tutorial/snowflake_partner_connect_box.png?v=2 "Snowflake Partner Connect Box")](#)Snowflake Partner Connect Box

   If you’re using the classic version of the Snowflake UI, you can click the **Partner Connect** button in the top bar of your account. From there, click on the dbt tile to open up the connect box.

   [![Snowflake Classic UI - Partner Connect](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/snowflake_tutorial/snowflake_classic_ui_partner_connect.png?v=2 "Snowflake Classic UI - Partner Connect")](#)Snowflake Classic UI - Partner Connect
2. In the **Connect to dbt** popup, find the **Optional Grant** option and select the **RAW** and **ANALYTICS** databases. This will grant access for your new dbt user role to each selected database. Then, click **Connect**.

[![dbt - Update Database and Warehouse](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/snowflake_tutorial/dbt_cloud_update_database_and_warehouse.png?v=2 "dbt - Update Database and Warehouse")](#)dbt - Update Database and Warehouse

1. Create a new project in dbt. Navigate to **Account settings** (by clicking on your account name in the left side menu), and click **+ New Project**.
2. Enter a project name and click **Continue**.
3. In the **Configure your development environment** section, click the **Connection** dropdown menu and select **Add new connection**. This directs you to the connection configuration settings.
4. In the **Type** section, select **Snowflake**.

   [![dbt - Choose Snowflake Connection](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/snowflake_tutorial/dbt_cloud_setup_snowflake_connection_start.png?v=2 "dbt - Choose Snowflake Connection")](#)dbt - Choose Snowflake Connection
5. Enter your **Settings** for Snowflake with:

   * **Account** — Find your account by using the Snowflake trial account URL and removing `snowflakecomputing.com`. The order of your account information will vary by Snowflake version. For example, Snowflake's Classic console URL might look like: `oq65696.west-us-2.azure.snowflakecomputing.com`. The AppUI or Snowsight URL might look more like: `snowflakecomputing.com/west-us-2.azure/oq65696`. In both examples, your account will be: `oq65696.west-us-2.azure`. For more information, see [Account Identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html) in the Snowflake docs.

     ✅ `db5261993` or `db5261993.east-us-2.azure`
       ❌ `db5261993.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com`
   * **Role** — Leave blank for now. You can update this to a default Snowflake role later.
   * **Database** — `analytics`. This tells dbt to create new models in the analytics database.
   * **Warehouse** — `transforming`. This tells dbt to use the transforming warehouse that was created earlier.

   [![dbt - Snowflake Account Settings](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/snowflake_tutorial/dbt_cloud_snowflake_account_settings.png?v=2 "dbt - Snowflake Account Settings")](#)dbt - Snowflake Account Settings
6. Click **Save**.
7. Set up your personal development credentials by going to **Your profile** > **Credentials**.
8. Select your project that uses the Snowflake connection.
9. Click the **configure your development environment and add a connection** link. This directs you to a page where you can enter your personal development credentials.
10. Enter your **Development credentials** for Snowflake with:

    * **Username** — The username you created for Snowflake. The username is not your email address and is usually your first and last name together in one word.
    * **Password** — The password you set when creating your Snowflake account.
    * **Schema** — You’ll notice that the schema name has been auto-created for you. By convention, this is `dbt_<first-initial><last-name>`. This is the schema connected directly to your development environment, and it's where your models will be built when running dbt within the Studio IDE.
    * **Target name** — Leave as the default.
    * **Threads** — Leave as 4. This is the number of simultaneous connects that dbt will make to build models concurrently.

    [![dbt - Snowflake Development Credentials](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/snowflake_tutorial/dbt_cloud_snowflake_development_credentials.png?v=2 "dbt - Snowflake Development Credentials")](#)dbt - Snowflake Development Credentials
11. Click **Test connection**. This verifies that dbt can access your Snowflake account.
12. If the test succeeded, click **Save** to complete the configuration. If it failed, you may need to check your Snowflake settings and credentials.

## Set up dbt project[​](#set-up-dbt-project "Direct link to Set up dbt project")

In this section, you will set up a dbt managed repository and initialize your dbt project to start developing.

### Set up a dbt managed repository[​](#set-up-a-dbt-managed-repository "Direct link to Set up a dbt managed repository")

If you used Partner Connect, you can skip to [initializing your dbt project](#initialize-your-dbt-project-and-start-developing) as Partner Connect provides you with a [managed repository](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository). Otherwise, you will need to create your repository connection.

When you develop in dbt, you can leverage [Git](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/git-version-control) to version control your code.

To connect to a repository, you can either set up a dbt-hosted [managed repository](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository) or directly connect to a [supported git provider](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/connect-github). Managed repositories are a great way to trial dbt without needing to create a new repository. In the long run, it's better to connect to a supported git provider to use features like automation and [continuous integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration).

To set up a managed repository:

1. Under "Setup a repository", select **Managed**.
2. Type a name for your repo such as `bbaggins-dbt-quickstart`
3. Click **Create**. It will take a few seconds for your repository to be created and imported.
4. Once you see the "Successfully imported repository," click **Continue**.

### Initialize your dbt project[​](#initialize-your-dbt-project "Direct link to Initialize your dbt project")

This guide assumes you use the [Studio IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio) to develop your dbt project, define metrics, and query and preview metrics using [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands).

Now that you have a repository configured, you can initialize your project and start development in dbt using the Studio IDE:

1. Click **Start developing in the Studio IDE**. It might take a few minutes for your project to spin up for the first time as it establishes your git connection, clones your repo, and tests the connection to the warehouse.
2. Above the file tree to the left, click **Initialize your project**. This builds out your folder structure with example models.
3. Make your initial commit by clicking **Commit and sync**. Use the commit message `initial commit`. This creates the first commit to your managed repo and allows you to open a branch where you can add a new dbt code.
4. You can now directly query data from your warehouse and execute `dbt run`. You can try this out now:
   * Delete the models/examples folder in the **File Catalog**.
   * Click **+ Create new file**, add this query to the new file, and click **Save as** to save the new file:

     ```
     select * from raw.jaffle_shop.customers
     ```
   * In the command line bar at the bottom, enter dbt run and click Enter. You should see a dbt run succeeded message.

## Build your dbt project[​](#build-your-dbt-project "Direct link to Build your dbt project")

The next step is to build your project. This involves adding sources, staging models, business-defined entities, and packages to your project.

### Add sources[​](#add-sources "Direct link to Add sources")

[Sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources) in dbt are the raw data tables you'll transform. By organizing your source definitions, you document the origin of your data. It also makes your project and transformation more reliable, structured, and understandable.

You have two options for working with files in the Studio IDE:

* **Create a new branch (recommended)** — Create a new branch to edit and commit your changes. Navigate to **Version Control** on the left sidebar and click **Create branch**.
* **Edit in the protected primary branch** — If you prefer to edit, format, or lint files and execute dbt commands directly in your primary git branch, use this option. The Studio IDE prevents commits to the protected branch so you'll be prompted to commit your changes to a new branch.

Name the new branch `build-project`.

1. Hover over the `models` directory and click the three-dot menu (**...**), then select **Create file**.
2. Name the file `staging/jaffle_shop/src_jaffle_shop.yml` , then click **Create**.
3. Copy the following text into the file and click **Save**.

models/staging/jaffle\_shop/src\_jaffle\_shop.yml

```
sources:
 - name: jaffle_shop
   database: raw
   schema: jaffle_shop
   tables:
     - name: customers
     - name: orders
```

tip

In your source file, you can also use the **Generate model** button to create a new model file for each source. This creates a new file in the `models` directory with the given source name and fill in the SQL code of the source definition.

4. Hover over the `models` directory and click the three dot menu (**...**), then select **Create file**.
5. Name the file `staging/stripe/src_stripe.yml` , then click **Create**.
6. Copy the following text into the file and click **Save**.

models/staging/stripe/src\_stripe.yml

```
sources:
 - name: stripe
   database: raw
   schema: stripe
   tables:
     - name: payment
```

### Add staging models[​](#add-staging-models "Direct link to Add staging models")

[Staging models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging) are the first transformation step in dbt. They clean and prepare your raw data, making it ready for more complex transformations and analyses. Follow these steps to add your staging models to your project.

1. In the `jaffle_shop` sub-directory, create the file `stg_customers.sql`. Or, you can use the **Generate model** button to create a new model file for each source.
2. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/staging/jaffle\_shop/stg\_customers.sql

```
  select
   id as customer_id,
   first_name,
   last_name
from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}
```

3. In the same `jaffle_shop` sub-directory, create the file `stg_orders.sql`
4. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/staging/jaffle\_shop/stg\_orders.sql

```
  select
    id as order_id,
    user_id as customer_id,
    order_date,
    status
  from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}
```

5. In the `stripe` sub-directory, create the file `stg_payments.sql`.
6. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/staging/stripe/stg\_payments.sql

```
select
   id as payment_id,
   orderid as order_id,
   paymentmethod as payment_method,
   status,
   -- amount is stored in cents, convert it to dollars
   amount / 100 as amount,
   created as created_at


from {{ source('stripe', 'payment') }}
```

7. Enter `dbt run` in the command prompt at the bottom of the screen. You should get a successful run and see the three models.

### Add business-defined entities[​](#add-business-defined-entities "Direct link to Add business-defined entities")

This phase involves creating [models that serve as the entity layer or concept layer of your dbt project](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts), making the data ready for reporting and analysis. It also includes adding [packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages) and the [MetricFlow time spine](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine) that extend dbt's functionality.

This phase is the [marts layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview#guide-structure-overview), which brings together modular pieces into a wide, rich vision of the entities an organization cares about.

1. Create the file `models/marts/fct_orders.sql`.
2. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/marts/fct\_orders.sql

```
with orders as  (
   select * from {{ ref('stg_orders' )}}
),


payments as (
   select * from {{ ref('stg_payments') }}
),


order_payments as (
   select
       order_id,
       sum(case when status = 'success' then amount end) as amount


   from payments
   group by 1
),


final as (


   select
       orders.order_id,
       orders.customer_id,
       orders.order_date,
       coalesce(order_payments.amount, 0) as amount


   from orders
   left join order_payments using (order_id)
)


select * from final
```

3. In the `models/marts` directory, create the file `dim_customers.sql`.
4. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/marts/dim\_customers.sql

```
with customers as (
   select * from {{ ref('stg_customers')}}
),
orders as (
   select * from {{ ref('fct_orders')}}
),
customer_orders as (
   select
       customer_id,
       min(order_date) as first_order_date,
       max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
       count(order_id) as number_of_orders,
       sum(amount) as lifetime_value
   from orders
   group by 1
),
final as (
   select
       customers.customer_id,
       customers.first_name,
       customers.last_name,
       customer_orders.first_order_date,
       customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
       coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders,
       customer_orders.lifetime_value
   from customers
   left join customer_orders using (customer_id)
)
select * from final
```

5. In your main directory, create the file `packages.yml`.
6. Copy the following text into the file and click **Save**.

packages.yml

```
packages:
 - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
   version: 1.1.1
```

7. In the `models` directory, create the file `metrics/metricflow_time_spine.sql` in your main directory.
8. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/metrics/metricflow\_time\_spine.sql

```
{{
   config(
       materialized = 'table',
   )
}}
with days as (
   {{
       dbt_utils.date_spine(
           'day',
           "to_date('01/01/2000','mm/dd/yyyy')",
           "to_date('01/01/2027','mm/dd/yyyy')"
       )
   }}
),
final as (
   select cast(date_day as date) as date_day
   from days
)
select * from final
```

9. Enter `dbt run` in the command prompt at the bottom of the screen. You should get a successful run message and also see in the run details that dbt has successfully built five models.

## Create semantic models[​](#create-semantic-models "Direct link to Create semantic models")

In this section, you'll learn about [semantic model](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/sl-snowflake-qs?step=6#about-semantic-models), [their components](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/sl-snowflake-qs?step=6#semantic-model-components), and [how to configure a time spine](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/sl-snowflake-qs?step=6#configure-a-time-spine).

### About semantic models[​](#about-semantic-models "Direct link to About semantic models")

[Semantic models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models) contain many object types (such as entities, measures, and dimensions) that allow MetricFlow to construct the queries for metric definitions.

* Each semantic model will be 1:1 with a dbt SQL/Python model.
* Each semantic model will contain (at most) 1 primary or natural entity.
* Each semantic model will contain zero, one, or many foreign or unique entities used to connect to other entities.
* Each semantic model may also contain dimensions, measures, and metrics. This is what actually gets fed into and queried by your downstream BI tool.

In the following steps, semantic models enable you to define how to interpret the data related to orders. It includes entities (like ID columns serving as keys for joining data), dimensions (for grouping or filtering data), and measures (for data aggregations).

1. In the `metrics` sub-directory, create a new file `fct_orders.yml`.

tip

Make sure to save all semantic models and metrics under the directory defined in the [`model-paths`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/model-paths) (or a subdirectory of it, like `models/semantic_models/`). If you save them outside of this path, it will result in an empty `semantic_manifest.json` file, and your semantic models or metrics won't be recognized.

2. Add the following code to that newly created file:

models/metrics/fct\_orders.yml

```
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: order_date
    description: |
      Order fact table. This table’s grain is one row per order.
    model: ref('fct_orders')
```

### Semantic model components[​](#semantic-model-components "Direct link to Semantic model components")

The following sections explain [dimensions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dimensions), [entities](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/entities), and [measures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/measures) in more detail, showing how they each play a role in semantic models.

* [Entities](#entities) act as unique identifiers (like ID columns) that link data together from different tables.
* [Dimensions](#dimensions) categorize and filter data, making it easier to organize.
* [Measures](#measures) calculates data, providing valuable insights through aggregation.

### Entities[​](#entities "Direct link to Entities")

[Entities](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models#entities) are a real-world concept in a business, serving as the backbone of your semantic model. These are going to be ID columns (like `order_id`) in our semantic models. These will serve as join keys to other semantic models.

Add entities to your `fct_orders.yml` semantic model file:

models/metrics/fct\_orders.yml

```
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: order_date
    description: |
      Order fact table. This table’s grain is one row per order.
    model: ref('fct_orders')
    # Newly added
    entities:
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer
        expr: customer_id
        type: foreign
```

### Dimensions[​](#dimensions "Direct link to Dimensions")

[Dimensions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models#entities) are a way to group or filter information based on categories or time.

Add dimensions to your `fct_orders.yml` semantic model file:

models/metrics/fct\_orders.yml

```
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: order_date
    description: |
      Order fact table. This table’s grain is one row per order.
    model: ref('fct_orders')
    entities:
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer
        expr: customer_id
        type: foreign
    # Newly added
    dimensions:
      - name: order_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
```

### Measures[​](#measures "Direct link to Measures")

[Measures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models#measures) are aggregations performed on columns in your model. Often, you’ll find yourself using them as final metrics themselves. Measures can also serve as building blocks for more complicated metrics.

Add measures to your `fct_orders.yml` semantic model file:

models/metrics/fct\_orders.yml

```
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: order_date
    description: |
      Order fact table. This table’s grain is one row per order.
    model: ref('fct_orders')
    entities:
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer
        expr: customer_id
        type: foreign
    dimensions:
      - name: order_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
    # Newly added
    measures:
      - name: order_total
        description: The total amount for each order including taxes.
        agg: sum
        expr: amount
      - name: order_count
        expr: 1
        agg: sum
      - name: customers_with_orders
        description: Distinct count of customers placing orders
        agg: count_distinct
        expr: customer_id
      - name: order_value_p99 ## The 99th percentile order value
        expr: amount
        agg: percentile
        agg_params:
          percentile: 0.99
          use_discrete_percentile: True
          use_approximate_percentile: False
```

### Configure a time spine[​](#configure-a-time-spine "Direct link to Configure a time spine")

To ensure accurate time-based aggregations, you must configure a [time spine](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine). The time spine allows you to have accurate metric calculations over different time granularities.

1. Add a time spine model to your project at whichever granularity needed for your metrics (like daily or hourly).
2. Configure each time spine in a YAML file to define how MetricFlow recognizes and uses its columns. Follow the instructions in [Configuring time spine in YAML](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine#configuring-time-spine-in-yaml) documenation.

For a step-by-step guide, refer to [MetricFlow time spine guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/mf-time-spine?step=1).

## Define metrics and add a second semantic model[​](#define-metrics-and-add-a-second-semantic-model "Direct link to Define metrics and add a second semantic model")

In this section, you will [define metrics](#define-metrics) and [add a second semantic model](#add-second-semantic-model-to-your-project) to your project.

### Define metrics[​](#define-metrics "Direct link to Define metrics")

[Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview) are the language your business users speak and measure business performance. They are an aggregation over a column in your warehouse that you enrich with dimensional cuts.

There are different types of metrics you can configure:

* [Conversion metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/conversion) — Track when a base event and a subsequent conversion event occur for an entity within a set time period.
* [Cumulative metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview#cumulative-metrics) — Aggregate a measure over a given window. If no window is specified, the window will accumulate the measure over all of the recorded time period. Note that you must create the time spine model before you add cumulative metrics.
* [Derived metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview#derived-metrics) — Allows you to do calculations on top of metrics.
* [Simple metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview#simple-metrics) — Directly reference a single measure without any additional measures involved.
* [Ratio metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview#ratio-metrics) — Involve a numerator metric and a denominator metric. A constraint string can be applied to both the numerator and denominator or separately to the numerator or denominator.

Once you've created your semantic models, it's time to start referencing those measures you made to create some metrics:

1. Add metrics to your `fct_orders.yml` semantic model file:

tip

Make sure to save all semantic models and metrics under the directory defined in the [`model-paths`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/model-paths) (or a subdirectory of it, like `models/semantic_models/`). If you save them outside of this path, it will result in an empty `semantic_manifest.json` file, and your semantic models or metrics won't be recognized.

### Add second semantic model to your project[​](#add-second-semantic-model-to-your-project "Direct link to Add second semantic model to your project")

Great job, you've successfully built your first semantic model! It has all the required elements: entities, dimensions, measures, and metrics.

Let’s expand your project's analytical capabilities by adding another semantic model in your other marts model, such as: `dim_customers.yml`.

After setting up your orders model:

1. In the `metrics` sub-directory, create the file `dim_customers.yml`.
2. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save**.

models/metrics/dim\_customers.yml

```
semantic_models:
  - name: customers
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: most_recent_order_date
    description: |
      semantic model for dim_customers
    model: ref('dim_customers')
    entities:
      - name: customer
        expr: customer_id
        type: primary
    dimensions:
      - name: customer_name
        type: categorical
        expr: first_name
      - name: first_order_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
      - name: most_recent_order_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
    measures:
      - name: count_lifetime_orders
        description: Total count of orders per customer.
        agg: sum
        expr: number_of_orders
      - name: lifetime_spend
        agg: sum
        expr: lifetime_value
        description: Gross customer lifetime spend inclusive of taxes.
      - name: customers
        expr: customer_id
        agg: count_distinct

metrics:
  - name: "customers_with_orders"
    label: "customers_with_orders"
    description: "Unique count of customers placing orders"
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure:
        name: customers
```

This semantic model uses simple metrics to focus on customer metrics and emphasizes customer dimensions like name, type, and order dates. It uniquely analyzes customer behavior, lifetime value, and order patterns.

## Test and query metrics[​](#test-and-query-metrics "Direct link to Test and query metrics")

To work with metrics in dbt, you have several tools to validate or run commands. Here's how you can test and query metrics depending on your setup:

* [**Studio IDE users**](#dbt-cloud-ide-users) — Run [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands#metricflow-commands) directly in the [Studio IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio) to query/preview metrics. View metrics visually in the **Lineage** tab.
* [**Cloud CLI users**](#dbt-cloud-cli-users) — The [Cloud CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) enables you to run [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands#metricflow-commands) to query and preview metrics directly in your command line interface.
* **dbt Core users** — Use the MetricFlow CLI for command execution. While this guide focuses on dbt users, dbt Core users can find detailed MetricFlow CLI setup instructions in the [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands#metricflow-commands) page. Note that to use the Semantic Layer, you need to have a [Starter or Enterprise-tier account](https://www.getdbt.com/).

Alternatively, you can run commands with SQL client tools like DataGrip, DBeaver, or RazorSQL.

### Studio IDE users[​](#studio-ide-users "Direct link to Studio IDE users")

You can use the `dbt sl` prefix before the command name to execute them in dbt. For example, to list all metrics, run `dbt sl list metrics`. For a complete list of the MetricFlow commands available in the Studio IDE, refer to the [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands#metricflow-commandss) page.

The Studio IDE **Status button** (located in the bottom right of the editor) displays an **Error** status if there's an error in your metric or semantic model definition. You can click the button to see the specific issue and resolve it.

Once viewed, make sure you commit and merge your changes in your project.

[![Validate your metrics using the Lineage tab in the IDE.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-ide-dag.png?v=2 "Validate your metrics using the Lineage tab in the IDE.")](#)Validate your metrics using the Lineage tab in the IDE.

### Cloud CLI users[​](#cloud-cli-users "Direct link to Cloud CLI users")

This section is for Cloud CLI users. MetricFlow commands are integrated with dbt, which means you can run MetricFlow commands as soon as you install the Cloud CLI. Your account will automatically manage version control for you.

Refer to the following steps to get started:

1. Install the [Cloud CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) (if you haven't already). Then, navigate to your dbt project directory.
2. Run a dbt command, such as `dbt parse`, `dbt run`, `dbt compile`, or `dbt build`. If you don't, you'll receive an error message that begins with: "ensure that you've ran an artifacts....".
3. MetricFlow builds a semantic graph and generates a `semantic_manifest.json` file in dbt, which is stored in the `/target` directory. If using the Jaffle Shop example, run `dbt seed && dbt run` to ensure the required data is in your data platform before proceeding.

Run dbt parse to reflect metric changes

When you make changes to metrics, make sure to run `dbt parse` at a minimum to update the Semantic Layer. This updates the `semantic_manifest.json` file, reflecting your changes when querying metrics. By running `dbt parse`, you won't need to rebuild all the models.

4. Run `dbt sl --help` to confirm you have MetricFlow installed and that you can view the available commands.
5. Run `dbt sl query --metrics <metric_name> --group-by <dimension_name>` to query the metrics and dimensions. For example, to query the `order_total` and `order_count` (both metrics), and then group them by the `order_date` (dimension), you would run:

   ```
   dbt sl query --metrics order_total,order_count --group-by order_date
   ```
6. Verify that the metric values are what you expect. To further understand how the metric is being generated, you can view the generated SQL if you type `--compile` in the command line.
7. Commit and merge the code changes that contain the metric definitions.

## Run a production job[​](#run-a-production-job "Direct link to Run a production job")

This section explains how you can perform a job run in your deployment environment in dbt to materialize and deploy your metrics. Currently, the deployment environment is only supported.

1. Once you’ve [defined your semantic models and metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/sl-snowflake-qs?step=10), commit and merge your metric changes in your dbt project.
2. In dbt, create a new [deployment environment](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#create-a-deployment-environment) or use an existing environment on dbt 1.6 or higher.

   * Note — Deployment environment is currently supported (*development experience coming soon*)
3. To create a new environment, navigate to **Deploy** in the navigation menu, select **Environments**, and then select **Create new environment**.
4. Fill in your deployment credentials with your Snowflake username and password. You can name the schema anything you want. Click **Save** to create your new production environment.
5. [Create a new deploy job](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs#create-and-schedule-jobs) that runs in the environment you just created. Go back to the **Deploy** menu, select **Jobs**, select **Create job**, and click **Deploy job**.
6. Set the job to run a `dbt parse` job to parse your projects and generate a [`semantic_manifest.json` artifact](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/sl-manifest) file. Although running `dbt build` isn't required, you can choose to do so if needed.

   note

   If you are on the dbt Fusion engine, add the `dbt docs generate` command to your job to successfully deploy your metrics.
7. Run the job by clicking the **Run now** button. Monitor the job's progress in real-time through the **Run summary** tab.

   Once the job completes successfully, your dbt project, including the generated documentation, will be fully deployed and available for use in your production environment. If any issues arise, review the logs to diagnose and address any errors.

What’s happening internally?

* Merging the code into your main branch allows dbt to pull those changes and build the definition in the manifest produced by the run.
* Re-running the job in the deployment environment helps materialize the models, which the metrics depend on, in the data platform. It also makes sure that the manifest is up to date.
* The Semantic Layer APIs pull in the most recent manifest and enables your integration to extract metadata from it.

## Administer the Semantic Layer[​](#administer-the-semantic-layer "Direct link to Administer the Semantic Layer")

In this section, you will learn how to add credentials and create service tokens to start querying the dbt Semantic Layer. This section goes over the following topics:

* [Select environment](#1-select-environment)
* [Configure credentials and create tokens](#2-configure-credentials-and-create-tokens)
* [View connection detail](#3-view-connection-detail)
* [Add more credentials](#4-add-more-credentials)
* [Delete configuration](#delete-configuration)

You must be part of the Owner group and have the correct [license](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) and [permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions) to administer the Semantic Layer at the environment and project level.

* Enterprise+ and Enterprise plan:
  + Developer license with Account Admin permissions, or
  + Owner with a Developer license, assigned Project Creator, Database Admin, or Admin permissions.
* Starter plan: Owner with a Developer license.
* Free trial: You are on a free trial of the Starter plan as an Owner, which means you have access to the dbt Semantic Layer.

### 1. Select environment[​](#1-select-environment "Direct link to 1. Select environment")

Select the environment where you want to enable the Semantic Layer:

1. Navigate to **Account settings** in the navigation menu.
2. Under **Settings**, click **Projects** and select the specific project you want to enable the Semantic Layer for.
3. In the **Project details** page, navigate to the **Semantic Layer** section. Select **Configure Semantic Layer**.

[![Semantic Layer section in the 'Project details' page](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/new-sl-configure.png?v=2 "Semantic Layer section in the 'Project details' page")](#)Semantic Layer section in the 'Project details' page

4. In the **Set Up Semantic Layer Configuration** page, select the deployment environment you want for the Semantic Layer and click **Save**. This provides administrators with the flexibility to choose the environment where the Semantic Layer will be enabled.

[![Select the deployment environment to run your Semantic Layer against.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-select-env.png?v=2 "Select the deployment environment to run your Semantic Layer against.")](#)Select the deployment environment to run your Semantic Layer against.

### 2. Configure credentials and create tokens[​](#2-configure-credentials-and-create-tokens "Direct link to 2. Configure credentials and create tokens")

There are two options for setting up Semantic Layer using API tokens:

* [Add a credential and create service tokens](#add-a-credential-and-create-service-tokens)
* [Configure development credentials and create personal tokens](#configure-development-credentials-and-create-a-personal-token)

#### Add a credential and create service tokens[​](#add-a-credential-and-create-service-tokens "Direct link to Add a credential and create service tokens")

The first option is to use [service tokens](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens) for authentication which are tied to an underlying data platform credential that you configure. The credential configured is used to execute queries that the Semantic Layer issues against your data platform.

This credential controls the physical access to underlying data accessed by the Semantic Layer, and all access policies set in the data platform for this credential will be respected.

* Click the **Add Semantic Layer credential** button.

##### 2. Configure credential[​](#2-configure-credential "Direct link to 2. Configure credential")

* In the **1. Add credentials** section, enter the credentials specific to your data platform that you want the Semantic Layer to use.
* Use credentials with minimal privileges. The Semantic Layer requires read access to the schema(s) containing the dbt models used in your semantic models for downstream applications
* Use [Extended Attributes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) and [Environment Variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables) when connecting to the Semantic Layer. If you set a value directly in the Semantic Layer Credentials, it will have a higher priority than Extended Attributes. When using environment variables, the default value for the environment will be used.

  For example, set the warehouse by using `{{env_var('DBT_WAREHOUSE')}}` in your Semantic Layer credentials.

  Similarly, if you set the account value using `{{env_var('DBT_ACCOUNT')}}` in Extended Attributes, dbt will check both the Extended Attributes and the environment variable.

##### 3. Create or link service tokens[​](#3-create-or-link-service-tokens "Direct link to 3. Create or link service tokens")

* If you have permission to create service tokens, you’ll see the [**Map new service token** option](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl#map-service-tokens-to-credentials) after adding the credential. Name the token, set permissions to 'Semantic Layer Only' and 'Metadata Only', and click **Save**.
* Once the token is generated, you won't be able to view this token again, so make sure to record it somewhere safe.
* If you don’t have access to create service tokens, you’ll see a message prompting you to contact your admin to create one for you. Admins can create and link tokens as needed.

[![If you don’t have access to create service tokens, you can create a credential and contact your admin to create one for you.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-credential-no-service-token.png?v=2 "If you don’t have access to create service tokens, you can create a credential and contact your admin to create one for you.")](#)If you don’t have access to create service tokens, you can create a credential and contact your admin to create one for you.

info

* Starter plans can create multiple service tokens that link to a single underlying credential, but each project can only have one credential.
* All Enterprise plans can [add multiple credentials](#4-add-more-credentials) and map those to service tokens for tailored access.

#### Configure development credentials and create a personal token[​](#configure-development-credentials-and-create-a-personal-token "Direct link to Configure development credentials and create a personal token")

Using [personal access tokens (PATs)](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/user-tokens) is also a supported authentication method for the dbt Semantic Layer. This enables user-level authentication, reducing the need for sharing tokens between users. When you authenticate using PATs, queries are run using your personal development credentials.

To use PATs in Semantic Layer:

1. Configure your development credentials.
   1. Click your account name at the bottom left-hand menu and go to **Account settings** > **Credentials**.
   2. Select your project.
   3. Click **Edit**.
   4. Go to **Development credentials** and enter your details.
   5. Click **Save**.
2. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/user-tokens). Make sure to copy the token.

You can use the generated PAT as the authentication method for Semantic Layer [APIs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview) and [integrations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations).

### 3. View connection detail[​](#3-view-connection-detail "Direct link to 3. View connection detail")

1. Go back to the **Project details** page for connection details to connect to downstream tools.
2. Copy and share the Environment ID, service or personal token, Host, as well as the service or personal token name to the relevant teams for BI connection setup. If your tool uses the GraphQL API, save the GraphQL API host information instead of the JDBC URL.

   For info on how to connect to other integrations, refer to [Available integrations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations).

[![After configuring, you'll be provided with the connection details to connect to you downstream tools.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-configure-example.png?v=2 "After configuring, you'll be provided with the connection details to connect to you downstream tools.")](#)After configuring, you'll be provided with the connection details to connect to you downstream tools.

### 4. Add more credentials [Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[​](#4-add-more-credentials- "Direct link to 4-add-more-credentials-")

All dbt Enterprise plans can optionally add multiple credentials and map them to service tokens, offering more granular control and tailored access for different teams, which can then be shared to relevant teams for BI connection setup. These credentials control the physical access to underlying data accessed by the Semantic Layer.

We recommend configuring credentials and service tokens to reflect your teams and their roles. For example, create tokens or credentials that align with your team's needs, such as providing access to finance-related schemas to the Finance team.

 Considerations for linking credentials

* Admins can link multiple service tokens to a single credential within a project, but each service token can only be linked to one credential per project.
* When you send a request through the APIs, the service token of the linked credential will follow access policies of the underlying view and tables used to build your semantic layer requests.
* Use [Extended Attributes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) and [Environment Variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables) when connecting to the Semantic Layer. If you set a value directly in the Semantic Layer Credentials, it will have a higher priority than Extended Attributes. When using environment variables, the default value for the environment will be used.

  For example, set the warehouse by using `{{env_var('DBT_WAREHOUSE')}}` in your Semantic Layer credentials.

  Similarly, if you set the account value using `{{env_var('DBT_ACCOUNT')}}` in Extended Attributes, dbt will check both the Extended Attributes and the environment variable.

#### 1. Add more credentials[​](#1-add-more-credentials "Direct link to 1. Add more credentials")

* After configuring your environment, on the **Credentials & service tokens** page, click the **Add Semantic Layer credential** button to create multiple credentials and map them to a service token.
* In the **1. Add credentials** section, fill in the data platform's credential fields. We recommend using “read-only” credentials.

  [![Add credentials and map them to a service token. ](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-add-credential.png?v=2 "Add credentials and map them to a service token. ")](#)Add credentials and map them to a service token.

#### 2. Map service tokens to credentials[​](#2-map-service-tokens-to-credentials "Direct link to 2. Map service tokens to credentials")

* In the **2. Map new service token** section, [map a service token to the credential](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl#map-service-tokens-to-credentials) you configured in the previous step. dbt automatically selects the service token permission set you need (Semantic Layer Only and Metadata Only).
* To add another service token during configuration, click **Add Service Token**.
* You can link more service tokens to the same credential later on in the **Semantic Layer Configuration Details** page. To add another service token to an existing Semantic Layer configuration, click **Add service token** under the **Linked service tokens** section.
* Click **Save** to link the service token to the credential. Remember to copy and save the service token securely, as it won't be viewable again after generation.

[![Use the configuration page to manage multiple credentials or link or unlink service tokens for more granular control.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-credentials-service-token.png?v=2 "Use the configuration page to manage multiple credentials or link or unlink service tokens for more granular control.")](#)Use the configuration page to manage multiple credentials or link or unlink service tokens for more granular control.

#### 3. Delete credentials[​](#3-delete-credentials "Direct link to 3. Delete credentials")

* To delete a credential, go back to the **Credentials & service tokens** page.
* Under **Linked Service Tokens**, click **Edit** and, select **Delete Credential** to remove a credential.

  When you delete a credential, any service tokens mapped to that credential in the project will no longer work and will break for any end users.

### Delete configuration[​](#delete-configuration "Direct link to Delete configuration")

You can delete the entire Semantic Layer configuration for a project. Note that deleting the Semantic Layer configuration will remove all credentials and unlink all service tokens to the project. It will also cause all queries to the Semantic Layer to fail.

Follow these steps to delete the Semantic Layer configuration for a project:

1. Navigate to the **Project details** page.
2. In the **Semantic Layer** section, select **Delete Semantic Layer**.
3. Confirm the deletion by clicking **Yes, delete semantic layer** in the confirmation pop up.

To re-enable the dbt Semantic Layer setup in the future, you will need to recreate your setup configurations by following the [previous steps](#set-up-dbt-semantic-layer). If your semantic models and metrics are still in your project, no changes are needed. If you've removed them, you'll need to set up the YAML configs again.

[![Delete the Semantic Layer configuration for a project.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-delete-config.png?v=2 "Delete the Semantic Layer configuration for a project.")](#)Delete the Semantic Layer configuration for a project.

## Additional configuration[​](#additional-configuration "Direct link to Additional configuration")

The following are the additional flexible configurations for Semantic Layer credentials.

### Map service tokens to credentials[​](#map-service-tokens-to-credentials "Direct link to Map service tokens to credentials")

* After configuring your environment, you can map additional service tokens to the same credential if you have the required [permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#permission-sets).
* Go to the **Credentials & service tokens** page and click the **+Add Service Token** button in the **Linked Service Tokens** section.
* Type the service token name and select the permission set you need (Semantic Layer Only and Metadata Only).
* Click **Save** to link the service token to the credential.
* Remember to copy and save the service token securely, as it won't be viewable again after generation.

[![Map additional service tokens to a credential.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-add-service-token.gif?v=2 "Map additional service tokens to a credential.")](#)Map additional service tokens to a credential.

### Unlink service tokens[​](#unlink-service-tokens "Direct link to Unlink service tokens")

* Unlink a service token from the credential by clicking **Unlink** under the **Linked service tokens** section. If you try to query the Semantic Layer with an unlinked credential, you'll experience an error in your BI tool because no valid token is mapped.

### Manage from service token page[​](#manage-from-service-token-page "Direct link to Manage from service token page")

**View credential from service token**

* View your Semantic Layer credential directly by navigating to the **API tokens** and then **Service tokens** page.
* Select the service token to view the credential it's linked to. This is useful if you want to know which service tokens are mapped to credentials in your project.

#### Create a new service token[​](#create-a-new-service-token "Direct link to Create a new service token")

* From the **Service tokens** page, create a new service token and map it to the credential(s) (assuming the semantic layer permission exists). This is useful if you want to create a new service token and directly map it to a credential in your project.
* Make sure to select the correct permission set for the service token (Semantic Layer Only and Metadata Only).

[![Create a new service token and map credentials directly on the separate 'Service tokens page'.](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-create-service-token-page.png?v=2 "Create a new service token and map credentials directly on the separate 'Service tokens page'.")](#)Create a new service token and map credentials directly on the separate 'Service tokens page'.

    group_by =
    [Dimension('metric_time').grain('day') ]
) }}
```

## What's next[​](#whats-next "Direct link to What's next")

Great job on completing the comprehensive Semantic Layer guide 🎉! You should hopefully have gained a clear understanding of what the Semantic Layer is, its purpose, and when to use it in your projects.

You've learned how to:

* Set up your Snowflake environment and dbt, including creating worksheets and loading data.
* Connect and configure dbt with Snowflake.
* Build, test, and manage dbt projects, focusing on metrics and semantic layers.
* Run production jobs and query metrics with our available integrations.

For next steps, you can start defining your own metrics and learn additional configuration options such as [exports](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/exports), [fill null values](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/advanced-topics), [implementing Mesh with the Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/sl-faqs#how-can-i-implement-dbt-mesh-with-the-dbt-semantic-layer), and more.
