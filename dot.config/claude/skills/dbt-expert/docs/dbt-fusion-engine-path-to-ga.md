Today, we announced that the dbt Fusion engine is [available in beta](https://getdbt.com/blog/get-to-know-the-new-dbt-fusion-engine-and-vs-code-extension).

* If Fusion works with your project today, great! You're in for a treat 😄
* If it's your first day using dbt, welcome! You should start on Fusion — you're in for a treat too.

Today is Launch Day — the first day of a new era: the Age of Fusion. We expect many teams with existing projects will encounter at least one issue that will prevent them from adopting the dbt Fusion engine in production environments. That's ok!

We're moving quickly to unblock more teams, and we are committing that by the time Fusion reaches General Availability:

* We will support Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift — and likely also Athena, Postgres, Spark, and Trino — with the new [Fusion Adapter pattern](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#dbt-fusion-engine-adapters).
* We will have coverage for (basically) all dbt Core functionality. Some things are impractical to replicate outside of Python, or so seldom-used that we'll be more reactive than proactive. On the other hand, many existing dbt Core behaviours will be improved by the unique capabilities of the dbt Fusion engine, such as speed and SQL comprehension. You'll see us talk about this in relevant GitHub issues, many of which we've linked below.
* The source-available `dbt-fusion` repository will contain more total functionality than what is available in dbt Core today. ([Read more about this here](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#ways-to-access).)
* The developer experience will be even speedier and more intuitive.

These statements aren't true yet — but you can see where we're headed. That's what betas are for, that's the journey we're going on together, and that's why we want to have you all involved.

**We will be adding functionality rapidly over the coming weeks.** In particular, keep an eye out for Databricks, BigQuery and Redshift support (in that order) in the coming weeks.

The most popular dbt Labs packages (`dbt_utils`, `audit_helper`, `dbt_external_tables`, `dbt_project_evaluator`) are already compatible with Fusion. Some external packages may not work out of the box, but we plan to work with package maintainers to get them ready & working on Fusion.

So when is Fusion going to be GA? We're targeting later this year for full feature parity, but we're also hoping to approach it asymptotically — meaning that many existing dbt users ca start adopting Fusion much sooner.

During the beta period, you may run into unanticipated (and anticipated) issues when trying to run your project on Fusion. Please share any issues in the [dbt-fusion](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion) repository or on Slack in [#dbt-fusion-engine](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C088YCAB6GH), and we'll do our best to to unblock you.

## Can I use Fusion for my dbt project today?[​](#can-i-use-fusion-for-my-dbt-project-today "Direct link to Can I use Fusion for my dbt project today?")

Maybe! The biggest first question: "Is your adapter supported yet?" (If not, sit tight, we're working fast!) If so, then it depends on the exact matrix of features you currently use in your dbt project.

You may be able to start using Fusion immediately, may need to make (mostly automatic) modifications to your project to resolve deprecations, or your project may not *yet* be parsable at all:

We're continuously removing blockers to Fusion adoption on a rolling basis during this beta period and in the leadup to a broader release. The rest of this post will go deeper into the four thematic criteria we set out above:

* Adapter coverage
* Feature coverage
* Source-available code publishing
* Developer experience improvements

## Requirement for GA: Adapter Coverage[​](#requirement-for-ga-adapter-coverage "Direct link to Requirement for GA: Adapter Coverage")

### Databricks, BigQuery and Redshift[​](#databricks-bigquery-and-redshift "Direct link to Databricks, BigQuery and Redshift")

dbt Fusion's adapters are now based on the [ADBC standard](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/driver/status.html), a modern, high-performance Apache project optimised for columnar analytical databases.

dbt Labs has developed new ADBC-compatible drivers (and a [supporting framework, XDBC](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#dbt-fusion-engine-adapters)) to complement the existing, stable Snowflake driver.

**Target release dates:** We expect to add support for [Databricks](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/4), [BigQuery](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/5), and [Redshift](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/6) (in that order) in the coming weeks.

Where possible, Fusion adapters will support the same authentication methods and connection/credential configurations as dbt Core adapters. We've also heard loud & clear feedback from dbt platform customers who have beta-tested the Fusion CLI — we want to figure out a way for Fusion CLI to use connection setup (config/creds) from the platform for local runs ([tracking issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/23)).

### Athena, Postgres, Spark and Trino[​](#athena-postgres-spark-and-trino "Direct link to Athena, Postgres, Spark and Trino")

We're aiming to support these adapters later in the year, prior to GA. Check each adapter's tracking issue ([Trino](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/39), [Athena](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/39), [Spark](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/38), and [Postgres](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/31)) for specific timelines.

### Custom adapters[​](#custom-adapters "Direct link to Custom adapters")

The short answer: Fusion's new adapter format could be extended to support community development of third-party adapters, but it's not on the near-term roadmap before GA ([tracking issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/46)).

The longer answer: Fusion now downloads necessary drivers (part of the adapter stack) on-demand. This dynamic linking requires the drivers to be signed by dbt Labs, meaning that we need to have a system in place to review contributions of new drivers and ensure their security.

In the meantime, if you want to migrate a supported project to the dbt Fusion engine but have a dependency on another project using a custom adapter, you can use a [Hybrid project](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/hybrid-setup) to have dbt Core execute the unsupported part of the pipeline and then publish artifacts for downstream projects to consume.

## Requirement for GA: Feature coverage[​](#requirement-for-ga-feature-coverage "Direct link to Requirement for GA: Feature coverage")

Feature coverage includes ensuring documented features work as expected, as well as (where possible) supporting undocumented "accidental" features.

Most of the time, even if your project uses an unimplemented feature, you can still take Fusion for a spin. This is because as long as your project parses, you can just skip unsupported models.

### Known unimplemented features[​](#known-unimplemented-features "Direct link to Known unimplemented features")

#### Python models[​](#python-models "Direct link to Python models")

Python models are the one exception to that "just skip them" advice. The dbt Fusion engine does not currently support parsing Python models, which means it can not extract refs or configs inside the files. Instead of potentially building models out of DAG order, **we've chosen to not support Python models at all for now**. They're coming back though - [check out the issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/3) for details.

#### Breadth of Materialization Support[​](#breadth-of-materialization-support "Direct link to Breadth of Materialization Support")

As of today we support the most common materializations: `table`, `view`, `incremental`, `ephemeral` for models — plus the materializations underlying snapshots, seeds, and tests. Other native strategies (like [microbatch incremental models](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/12), [iceberg tables](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/28), [materialized views/dynamic tables](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/27), or [stored test failures](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/15)) as well as [custom materializations](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/17) are on the roadmap — check their respective issues to see when.

It's worth reiterating here: Even if you have models that rely on not-yet-supported materialization strategies, you can still try the dbt Fusion engine in the rest of your project. The rest of your DAG will build as normal, but unsupported strategies will raise an error if they are included in scope of `dbt build` or `dbt run`.

To exclude those nodes, use a command like

* `dbt build --exclude config.materialized:my_custom_mat`
* `dbt build --exclude config.incremental_strategy:microbatch`

#### Other common features[​](#other-common-features "Direct link to Other common features")

Did you know that there are over 400 documented features of dbt? [Doug](https://github.com/dbeatty10) does, because he had to put them all into a Notion database.

Fusion already supports two-thirds of them, and we have a plan for the rest. You can follow along at [the `dbt-fusion` repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues), where there are issues to track the outstanding behaviours. There's also a rough set of milestones attached, but those are subject to reordering as more teams start using Fusion and giving feedback.

Some of the most relevant ones include:

* [Exposures](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/13)
* A new [stable logging system](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/7)
* A new [local documentation experience](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/9) that replaces dbt-docs (!)
* [Programmatic invocations](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/10)
* [Model governance](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/25) (contracts, constraints, access, deprecation\_date)
* A grab bag of CLI commands like [`dbt clone`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/22), [`state:modified.subselector`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/33), [`--empty`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/34), ...

It's worth noting that *resolution* doesn't necessarily mean identical behaviours. As a couple of examples:

* Many of these behaviours have not been implemented yet because the Fusion engine introduces new capabilities, above all SQL comprehension, that we will leverage to provide a superior experience. A direct port-over of the feature would miss the point.
* Others (like the events and logging system) are tightly coupled to dbt Core's Python roots — they're worth a rethink, and not worth shooting for exact 100% conformance

Here's a point-in-time snapshot of how we expect to tackle the known remaining work. Please refer to the [repository's issues page](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues) as the source of truth:

### Surprise unimplemented features[​](#surprise-unimplemented-features "Direct link to Surprise unimplemented features")

Did you know that there are also over a bajillion *undocumented* features of dbt? Since March, we've been validating the new engine's parser against projects orchestrated by the dbt platform, which has flagged hundreds of divergent behaviours and common parse bugs.

But we also know there is a long tail of behaviours that will only arise in the wild, and that the easiest way to get to the bottom of them will be to work with users.

This work will be ongoing, alongside feature support. When you start using the Fusion engine, please [open an issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues) if you hit an unexpected error — and please include a basic project that reproduces the error, so we can fix it!

## Requirement for GA: The Source-available `dbt-fusion` codebase is better than `dbt-core` for most use cases[​](#requirement-for-ga-the-source-available-dbt-fusion-codebase-is-better-than-dbt-core-for-most-use-cases "Direct link to requirement-for-ga-the-source-available-dbt-fusion-codebase-is-better-than-dbt-core-for-most-use-cases")

By GA, the [`dbt-fusion` repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion) will have the necessary (and fully source-available) components to compile a functional engine for the vast majority of dbt Core projects — and a faster one at that. That means that you will always have the ability to compile, use, and modify this code itself, without requiring access to the dbt Labs provided binary (although we think you'll probably just want to use the binary, for reasons detailed in the [Components of the dbt Fusion engine](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components) post).

So far, we've released the code necessary to self-compile a dbt binary that can run `dbt deps` and `dbt parse`. Throughout the beta period we will continue to prepare more code for use by those who want to view, contribute to, or modify the code for their own purposes, including what's necessary for the rest of the commands to work.

Beyond just the code necessary to produce a complete dbt binary, we've also committed to open-sourcing several of the underlying library components (such as dbt-jinja, dbt-serde-yaml, and the grammars necessary to produce a high-performance SQL parser). Again, check out the [Components of the dbt Fusion engine](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components) post for the details.

Some behaviours that worked in dbt Core won't have an equivalent in this new codebase. The most obvious examples are those which depended on the vagaries of Python: arbitrary callbacks on the EventManager (there's no longer an EventManager on which to register a callback!), the experimental [plugins system](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/plugins/manager.py) (dynamic loading of binaries works completely differently in Rust and would require signing), or the dbt templater in SQLFluff (which hooked into dbt Core beyond the exposed interfaces - although we plan to build a [fast linter ourselves](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/11)).

## Requirement for GA: The DX rocks[​](#requirement-for-ga-the-dx-rocks "Direct link to Requirement for GA: The DX rocks")

### More speed[​](#more-speed "Direct link to More speed")

Invocations powered by the dbt Fusion engine are already significantly faster than the same invocation in dbt Core, but there's more to do here! We know that there is still a lot of low-hanging fruit, and by GA we expect to see tasks like full project compilation complete at least twice as fast for many projects.

If you do some benchmarking, we're particularly interested in any situations where Fusion "pauses" on a single file for a couple of seconds. Some other things to keep in mind:

* Writing very large manifests is pretty slow, no matter what. Try including `--no-write-json`. We're wondering whether it makes sense to have a trimmed-down manifest by default. What do you think?
* The `dbt compile` command involves more work in Fusion than in dbt Core, because it's doing full SQL validation. To compare *just* the SQL rendering step (the equivalent of dbt Core's `compile` command), you can try [turning off static analysis](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/fusion/new-concepts) with the CLI flag `--static-analysis off`.

As a sign of what's possible, take note of the incremental recompilation used to provide real-time feedback in the VS Code extension.

### A more info-dense console output[​](#a-more-info-dense-console-output "Direct link to A more info-dense console output")

While we were preparing for the beta release, we kept the Fusion CLI output intentionally verbose — it displays *everything* that's happening, which means errors and warnings can be pushed out of view by other status updates. We're already in the process of [clearing this up a bit](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/52), and we've got some funny ideas about the possibility of progress bars. However we do it, the goal should be that you see the log lines about things that need attention, and not much more.

### Your idea here[​](#your-idea-here "Direct link to Your idea here")

What feels *off* when you're using dbt Fusion? Tell us all about it — if you've got a clear idea for what's wrong and what it should be instead, feel free to jump straight to a GitHub issue. Bonus points if you've got a minimal repro project.

If you need to kick an idea around before opening an issue, we'll also be actively checking in on #dbt-fusion-engine (for high-level discussions) and #dbt-fusion-engine-migration (to get into the weeds of a specific bug) on Slack.

From now until Fusion is GA, we will be prioritizing parity with existing framework features, *not adding new ones.* Once we hit GA, we'll think about whether to transfer existing feature requests from the `dbt-core` repo to `dbt-fusion` — or maybe a third place? — stay tuned.

## Following along[​](#following-along "Direct link to Following along")

The path to GA for Fusion is a Community-wide effort. We want to hear from you, work with you, get your ideas and feedback. Whether it is sharing a bug report, an idea for a feature or more high level thoughts and feedback, we're looking to engage with you.

* In Slack, we're on [#dbt-fusion-engine](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C088YCAB6GH) and #dbt-fusion-engine-migration
* The GitHub repo is <https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion>
* There are a couple of dozen *dbt World Circuit* meetups happening globally during June: <https://www.meetup.com/pro/dbt/>. (Jeremy will be speaking in Paris, Marseille, and Boston — come hang out!)
* We'll be having regular office hours with a revolving cast of characters from the Developer Experience, Engineering, and Product teams. Dates will be circulated in the #dbt-fusion-engine channel.
