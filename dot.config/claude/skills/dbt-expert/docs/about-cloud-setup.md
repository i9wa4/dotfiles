dbt platform (formerly dbt Cloud) is the fastest and most reliable way to deploy your dbt jobs. It contains a myriad of settings that can be configured by admins, from the necessities (data platform integration) to security enhancements (SSO) and quality-of-life features (RBAC).

This portion of our documentation will take you through the various settings in the dbt UI, including:

* [Connecting to a data platform](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections)
* Configuring access to [GitHub](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/connect-github), [GitLab](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/connect-gitlab), or your own [git repo URL](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url).
* [Managing users and licenses](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users)
* [Configuring secure access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access)

For steps on installing dbt development tools, refer to the [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) or the [Studio IDE (browser-based)](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio).

These settings are intended for dbt administrators. If you need a more detailed first-time setup guide for specific data platforms, read our [quickstart guides](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides) or follow the [dbt platform configuration checklist](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuration-checklist). If you want a more in-depth learning experience, we recommend taking the dbt Fundamentals on our [dbt Learn site](https://learn.getdbt.com/).

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* To set up dbt, you'll need to have a dbt account with administrator access. If you still need to create a dbt account, [sign up today](https://getdbt.com) on our North American servers or [contact us](https://getdbt.com/contact) for international options.
* To have the best experience using dbt, we recommend you use modern and up-to-date web browsers like Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox.
