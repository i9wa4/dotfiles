## Style Analysis from Recent Netrw PRs

Based on analysis of PRs 17635, 17616, 17539, 17514, and 17230:

### Commit Message Format
- **Title**: Always starts with `runtime(netrw):` prefix
- **Style**: Brief, lowercase after prefix (e.g., "upstream snapshot of v183", "fix blank lines")
- **Length**: Usually under 60 characters
- **Body**: 
  - Multi-line for complex changes
  - Bullet points for listing multiple changes
  - Technical but concise
  - References specific functions/variables when relevant

### PR Body Structure
1. **Minimal style** (saccarosium's PRs):
   - Very brief, often just "relevant commits:" followed by bullet list
   - No elaborate problem/solution sections
   - Example from PR 17616:
     ```
     relevant commits:
     - refactor: cleanup netrw#BrowseX
     - fix: correctly handle symlinks in treeview
     - chore: add minimalrc for reproducing issues
     ```

2. **Detailed style** (external contributors like PR 17230):
   - Clear problem statement
   - Setup/reproduction steps with code
   - Sometimes includes asciicasts or screenshots
   - More formal structure

### Key Observations
- Maintainer (saccarosium) uses extremely concise PR descriptions
- Commit messages in body often use conventional commit prefixes (fix:, refactor:, chore:)
- No emojis or excessive formatting
- Technical details are presented matter-of-factly
- Version snapshots (v182, v183) are common for bundled updates

## Updated PR Approach

## Title
```
runtime(netrw): restore blank line cleanup in file listings
```

## Description (Concise Style)
```markdown
After v182 refactoring, blank lines appear between directories and files in netrw listings.

The refactoring removed `s:LocalListing()` but didn't include its blank line cleanup (`g/^$/d`), present since 2005.

This restores the missing cleanup after `append()` in `s:PerformListing()`.
```

## Description (Detailed Style - if requested)
```markdown
## Problem

After v182 refactoring (commit ef925556c), blank lines appear between directory and file sections in netrw listings.

## Root Cause

The v182 refactoring removed the `s:LocalListing()` function but failed to carry over its blank line cleanup code. This cleanup code has been part of netrw since 2005 (nearly 20 years):

```vim
" cleanup any windows mess at end-of-line
sil! NetrwKeepj g/^$/d
```

The `g/^$/d` command was essential for removing empty lines that can appear during file listing generation, but it was not included when `s:LocalListing()` was replaced with a simpler `append()` implementation.

**Before v182** (in `s:LocalListing`):
```vim
let filelist = s:NetrwLocalListingList(b:netrw_curdir, 1)
for filename in filelist
    sil! NetrwKeepj put =filename
endfor

" cleanup any windows mess at end-of-line
sil! NetrwKeepj g/^$/d
sil! NetrwKeepj %s/\r$//e
```

**After v182** (in `s:PerformListing`):
```vim
let filelist = s:NetrwLocalListingList(b:netrw_curdir, 1)
call append(w:netrw_bannercnt - 1, filelist)
execute printf("setl ts=%d", g:netrw_maxfilenamelen + 1)
" Missing: g/^$/d cleanup!
```

## Solution

This PR restores the missing blank line cleanup after the `append()` call in `s:PerformListing()`.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Use Vim built after June 27, 2025 (after v182)
2. Run `:Ex` to open netrw
3. Navigate to a directory containing both subdirectories and files
4. Observe blank line between the last directory and first file

Example output with the bug:
```
etc/

.gitignore
LICENSE
```

Expected output (after fix):
```
etc/
.gitignore
LICENSE
```

## Testing

Tested locally with the fix applied - blank lines no longer appear between directories and files.
```

## Commit Message Proposals

### Option 1: Concise (saccarosium style)
```
runtime(netrw): restore blank line cleanup in file listings

Problem: v182 refactoring removed blank line cleanup (g/^$/d) from
s:LocalListing(), causing empty lines between directories and files.

Solution: Add the missing cleanup after append() in s:PerformListing().

```

### Option 2: Detailed
```
runtime(netrw): fix blank lines between directories and files

Problem: v182 refactoring (ef925556c) removed s:LocalListing() function
but did not include its blank line cleanup code (g/^$/d) in the new
implementation. This cleanup has been present since 2005.

Solution: Add the missing blank line cleanup after append() in
s:PerformListing().

The regression was introduced by the "Tune local file listing" change
which replaced s:LocalListing() with a direct append() call.

```

### Option 3: Minimal (for snapshot-style PRs)
```
runtime(netrw): fix blank line cleanup regression from v182

- restore g/^$/d cleanup in s:PerformListing()
- fixes empty lines between directories and files
