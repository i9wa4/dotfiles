Available to certain Enterprise tiers

The private connection feature is available on the following dbt Enterprise tiers:

* Business Critical
* Virtual Private

To learn more about these tiers, contact us at [sales@getdbt.com](mailto:sales@getdbt.com).

Private connections enables secure communication from any dbt environment to your data platform hosted on a cloud provider, such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/private-link), using that provider’s private connection technology. Private connections allow dbt customers to meet security and compliance controls as it allows connectivity between dbt and your data platform without traversing the public internet. This feature is supported in most regions across North America, Europe, and Asia, but [contact us](https://www.getdbt.com/contact/) if you have questions about availability.

Private connection endpoints can't connect across cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP). For a private connection to work, both dbt and the server (like a data platform) must be hosted on the same cloud provider. For example, dbt hosted on AWS cannot connect to services hosted on Azure, and dbt hosted on Azure can’t connect to services hosted on GCP.

### Cross-region private connections[​](#cross-region-private-connections "Direct link to Cross-region private connections")

dbt Labs has globally connected private networks specifically used to host private endpoints, which are connected to dbt instance environments. This connectivity allows for dbt environments to connect to any supported region from any dbt instance within the same cloud provider network. To ensure security, access to these endpoints is protected by security groups, network policies, and application connection safeguards, in addition to the authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by each of the connected platforms.

### Configuring private connections[​](#configuring-private-connections "Direct link to Configuring private connections")

dbt supports the following data platforms for use with the private connections feature. Instructions for enabling private connections for the various data platform providers are unique. The following guides will walk you through the necessary steps, including working with [dbt Support](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/getting-help#dbt-cloud-support) to complete the connection in the dbt private network and setting up the endpoint in dbt.

Environment variables

Using [Environment variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables) when configuring private connection endpoints isn't supported in dbt. Instead, use [Extended Attributes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#extended-attributes) to dynamically change these values in your dbt environment.
