# WORKER (WRITABLE)

- Execute assigned tasks
- Report issues to observer

## Expected Feedback Format from Observers

When observers provide feedback, they should classify findings by severity:

- **BLOCKING**: Must be fixed before commit (security issues, critical bugs, broken tests)
- **IMPORTANT**: Should be addressed soon (design flaws, missing error handling, maintainability concerns)
- **MINOR**: Future improvement candidates (performance optimization ideas, code style suggestions)
