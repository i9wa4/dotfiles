Available to Enterprise-tier plans

This feature is available to the dbt Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans. If you're interested in learning more, contact us at [sales@getdbt.com](mailto:sales@getdbt.com).

The dbt Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans support a number of pre-built permission sets to help manage access controls within a dbt account. See the docs on [access control](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access) for more information on Role-Based access control (RBAC).

## Permission sets[​](#permission-sets "Direct link to Permission sets")

The following permission sets are available for assignment in all dbt Enterprise-tier accounts. They can be granted to dbt groups and then to users. A dbt group can be associated with more than one permission set. Permission assignments with more access take precedence.

Access to dbt features and functionality is split into `account-level` and `project-level` permission sets. Account-level permissions are primarily for account administration (inviting users, configuring SSO, and creating groups). Project-level permissions are for the configuration and maintenance of the projects themselves (configuring environments, accessing IDE, and running jobs). Account permission sets may have access to project features, and project permission sets may have access to account features. Check out the [permissions tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#account-permissions) to compare sets and their access.

 Account admin

The Account admin permission set is the highest level of access and control over your dbt account and projects. We recommend limiting the number of users and groups assigned the account admin permission set.

Notable features:

* Unrestricted access to every feature.
* The default permissions for every user who creates a new dbt account.
* The default permissions assigned to the `Owner` group.

 Admin

The Admin permission set is intended for project administration but with limited account-level access to invite and assign users.

Notable features:

* Admin is a project-level set.
* Unrestricted access to existing projects, but can't create new projects.
* Can invite new members and assign access but can't create groups.
* Can access Catalog.

 Analyst

The Analyst permission set is designed for users who need to run and analyze dbt models in the IDE but can't create or edit anything outside the IDE.

Notable features:

* Analyst is a project-level set.
* Full access to the IDE and the ability to configure personal credentials for adapters and Git.
* Read-only access to environment configs.

 Developer

The Developer permission set is intended for users who build and maintain dbt models under development and manage production behavior.

Notable features:

See the [dbt platform Fusion upgrade](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#dbt-fusion-engine) docs for more information.

Notable features:

* Metadata is a project-level set.
* Grants read-only access to metadata related to dbt models, runs, sources, and tests.
* No access to modify, execute, or manage dbt jobs, repositories, or users.
* No other access to dbt features.

 Project creator

The Project creator permission set can create, configure, and set up new projects. It is recommended for the admin of teams that will own a project.

Notable features:

* Only permission set other than Account admin that can create projects.
* Limited account settings access. The project creator can create and edit connections, invite users, create groups, and assign licenses.
* Unrestricted access to project configurations.
* Can access Catalog

 Security admin

Security admins have limited access to the security settings and policies for the dbt account. This is intended for members of a security team who need to ensure compliance with security standards and oversee the implementation of best security practices across the account. The [IT license-type](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users#licenses) includes this permission set by default.

Notable features:

* Security admin is an account-level set.
* Can create and edit users and groups and assign licenses.

* Can create and edit IP restrictions and service tokens, as well as manage user access controls.
* No access to jobs, runs, environments, or the IDE.

 Semantic Layer

* No other access to dbt features.

 Stakeholder and Read-Only

* Read-only access to projects, environments, jobs, and runs.
* Read-only access to user and group information.
* Can access Catalog.
* No access to the IDE.

 Team admin

Team admin is an administrative permission set intended for team leaders or similar personas. The permissions grants the ability to manage projects for the team.

Notable features:

* Team admin is a project-level set.
* Access to manage the project(s) for a team of users. Limited scope and access can be extended via environment permissions.
* Read-only access to many account settings (excluding sensitive content like billing and auth providers).
* Can access Catalog.

 Viewer

The Account Viewer permissions set provides read-only access to the dbt account. Useful for any persona who needs insights into your dbt account without access to create or change configurations.

The Viewer permission set is frequently paired with the [Read-only license-type](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users).

Notable features:

* Viewer is an account-level set.
* Read-only access to all settings, projects, environments, and runs.
* Read-only access to audit logs, including sensitive account-level information.
* No access to the IDE.
* Can access Catalog

License types override group permissions

**User license types always override their assigned group permission sets.** For example, a user with a Read-Only license cannot perform administrative actions, even if they belong to an Account Admin group.

This ensures that license restrictions are always enforced, regardless of group membership.

Permissions:

* **Account-level permissions** — Permissions related to the management of the dbt account. For example, billing and account settings.
* **Project-level permissions** — Permissions related to the projects in dbt. For example, repos and access to the Studio IDE or Cloud CLI.

note

Some permissions sets have read-only access to environment settings that can be overriden with more privileged access if the user is assigned to a group with [Environment write access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#environment-write-access) configured.

### Account permissions[​](#account-permissions "Direct link to Account permissions")

Account permission sets enable you to manage the dbt account and manage the account settings (for example, generating service tokens, inviting users, and configuring SSO). They also provide project-level permissions. The **Account Admin** permission set is the highest level of access you can assign.

Key:

* **(W)rite** — Create new or modify existing. Includes `send`, `create`, `delete`, `allocate`, `modify`, and `develop`.
* **(R)ead** — Can view but cannot create or change any fields.

### Project permissions[​](#project-permissions "Direct link to Project permissions")

The project permission sets enable you to work within the projects in various capacities. They primarily provide access to project-level permissions such as repos and the Studio IDE or Cloud CLI, but may also provide some account-level permissions.

Key:

* **(W)rite** — Create new or modify existing. Includes `send`, `create`, `delete`, `allocate`, `modify`, and `develop`.
* **(R)ead** — Can view but can not create or change any fields.
