## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

As a solutions architect at dbt Labs, my role is to help our customers and prospects understand how to best utilize the dbt Cloud platform to solve their unique data challenges. That uniqueness presents itself in different ways - organizational maturity, data stack, team size and composition, technical capability, use case, or some combination of those. With all those differences though, there has been one common thread throughout most of my engagements: Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Data teams are either 1) proactively thinking about applications for it in the context of their work or 2) being pushed to think about it by their stakeholders. It has become the elephant in every single (zoom) room I find myself in.
