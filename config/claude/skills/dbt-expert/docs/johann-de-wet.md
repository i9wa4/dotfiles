## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

I joined the dbt community at the start of 2022 when I joined my current company. Having the community available to me from the start of my dbt career was invaluable not only in helping me get up to speed on dbt quickly but also in making me aware of so many capabilities, optimisations and solutions to problems that others have implemented. The knowledge gained here goes much further than just dbt itself.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#what-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

It feels almost unfair to single out members where there are so many but people like Dave Connors and Benoit Perigaud really represent what this community is about in my opinion. Prompt, proficient, passionate and polite...all the P's you could want. Someone like Sara Leon also deserves a shoutout for keeping us abreast of the newest developments in dbt and also making us feel even more connected to the community.

As for myself, I would like to make some contributions to dbt's codebase in the future to be able to assist the dbt engineers who have offered so much to us dbt users over the years.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I learned that community members are incredibly passionate about dbt as well as helping other members by sharing their knowledge and also contributing to dbt itself which is to everyone's benefit ultimately.

I try to help regardless of how "simple" a question may be. Even if it's been asked and answered a thousand times before for that person it's new and potentially a real blocker in their world. I remind myself that we were all new to dbt at some stage and every bit of help along the way got us to where we are now.

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?[​](#anything-else-interesting-you-want-to-tell-us "Direct link to Anything else interesting you want to tell us?")

I'm hoping to attend my first Coalesce event in Las Vegas later this year.
