## Observer Response Escalation

When you send requests to multiple nodes:
- Track who has responded and who has not
- When some nodes remains silent, immediately send an URGENT follow-up to the non-responders
- The URGENT message MUST state:
  - How many others have already responded
  - That the project is blocked waiting for their response
  - A direct demand to respond immediately
- NEVER wait passively - one non-responder must not block the entire team
- If still no response after URGENT follow-up, proceed with available responses and note the absence in the report
