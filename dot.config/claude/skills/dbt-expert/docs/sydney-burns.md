## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

The stack I used in my first data role was outdated and highly manual. Where I live, modern tech companies are few and far between, and I didn't have many in-person resources nor enough knowledge to realize that another world was possible at my skill level. I was thrilled to find a pocket of the Internet where similarly frustrated but creative data folks were sharing thoughtful solutions to problems I'd been struggling with!

## What dbt community leader do you identify with?

Christine Berger was my first ever (best ever!) data colleague, and the one who first introduced me to dbt.

There are certain qualities I've always valued in her, that I've found in many others across the community, and strive to cultivate in myself — earnestness, curiosity, creativity, and consistently doing good work with deep care.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I spent too much time in my early career feeling scared to ask for help because I didn't want others to think I was incompetent. I'd spin my wheels on something for hours before finally asking someone to help me.

The community has proven one thing to me time and time again: there are people here who will not only help you, but will be palpably *excited* to help you and share what they know, especially if it's clear you've made efforts to use your resources and try things on your own first. I'm one of those people now!
