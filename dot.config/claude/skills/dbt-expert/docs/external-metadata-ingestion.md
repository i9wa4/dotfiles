With external metadata ingestion, you can connect directly to your data warehouse, giving you visibility into tables, views, and other resources that aren't defined in dbt with Catalog.

External metadata ingestion support

Currently, external metadata ingestion is supported for Snowflake only.

External metadata credentials enable ingestion of metadata that exists *outside* your dbt runs like tables, views, or cost information; typically at a higher level than what dbt environments access. This is useful for enriching Catalog with warehouse-native insights (for example, Snowflake views or access patterns) and creating a unified discovery experience.

These credentials are configured separately from dbt environment credentials and are scoped at the account level, not the project level.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* Have a dbt account on the [Enterprise or Enterprise+](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) plan.
* You must be an [account admin with permission](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#account-admin) to edit connections.
  + The credentials must have [sufficient read-level access to fetch metadata](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/external-metadata-ingestion#configuration-instructions).
* Have [**global navigation**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects#catalog-overview) enabled.
* Use Snowflake as your data platform.
* Stayed tuned! Coming very soon, there’ll be support in future for other adapters!

## Configuration instructions[​](#configuration-instructions "Direct link to Configuration instructions")

### Enable external metadata ingestion[​](#enable-external-metadata-ingestion "Direct link to Enable external metadata ingestion")

1. Click your account name at the bottom of the left-side menu and click **[Account settings](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-settings)**.
2. Under Account information, go to **Settings** and click **Edit** at the top right corner of the page.
3. Select the **Ingest external metadata in dbt Catalog (formerly dbt Explorer)** option (if not already enabled).

### Configure the warehouse connection[​](#configure-the-warehouse-connection "Direct link to Configure the warehouse connection")

1. Go to **Account settings**.
2. Click **Connections** from the left-hand side panel.
3. Select an existing connection or create a [**New connection**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-snowflake) where you want to ingest metadata from.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Add credentials** in **Platform metadata credentials**.
   * Enter the necessary credentials. These should have warehouse-level visibility across relevant databases and schemas.
   * If you have multiple connections that reference the same account identifier, you will only be prompted to add platform metadata credentials to one of them. Other connections using the same account identifier will display a message indicating that platform metadata credentials are already configured.
5. Select the **External metadata ingestion** option.
   * This allows metadata from this connection to populate the Catalog.
   * *Optional*: Enable additional features such as **cost optimization** in the **Features** section under **Platform metadata credentials**.
6. Under **Catalog filters**, apply filters to restrict which metadata is ingested:
   * You can filter by **database**, **schema**, **table**, or **view**.
     + **Note:** To include all databases or schemas, enter `.*` in the **Allow** field.
   * It is strongly recommend to filter by certain schemas. See [Important considerations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/external-metadata-ingestion#important-considerations) for more information.
   * These fields accept CSV-formatted regular expressions:
     + Example: `DIM` matches `DIM_ORDERS` and `DIMENSION_TABLE` (basic "contains" match).
     + Wildcards are supported. For example: `DIM*` matches `DIM_ORDERS` and `DIM_PRODUCTS`.

## Required credentials[​](#required-credentials "Direct link to Required credentials")

This section sets up the foundational access for dbt in Snowflake. It creates a role (`dbt_metadata_role`) with minimal permissions and a user (`dbt_metadata_user`) dedicated to dbt’s metadata access. This ensures a clear, controlled separation of access, so dbt can read metadata without broader permissions. This setup ensures dbt can read metadata for profiling, documentation, and lineage, without the ability to modify data or manage resources.

1. Create role:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
```

2. Grant access to a warehouse to run queries to view metadata:

```
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE "<your-warehouse>" TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
```

If your warehouse needs to be restarted for metadata ingestions (doesn't have auto-resume enabled), you may need to grant `OPERATE` permissions to the role as well.
If you do not already have a user, create a dbt-specific user for metadata access. Replace `<your-password>` with a strong password and `<your-warehouse>` with the warehouse name used above:

```
CREATE USER dbt_metadata_user
  DISPLAY_NAME = 'dbt Metadata Integration'
  PASSWORD = 'our-password>'
  DEFAULT_ROLE = dbt_metadata_role
  TYPE = 'LEGACY_SERVICE'
  DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = '<your-warehouse>';
```

3. Grant the role to the user:

```
GRANT ROLE dbt_metadata_role TO USER dbt_metadata_user;
```

Note: Use read-only service accounts for least privilege and better auditing.

## Assign metadata access privileges[​](#assign-metadata-access-privileges "Direct link to Assign metadata access privileges")

This section outlines the minimum necessary privileges to read metadata from each required Snowflake database. It provides access to schemas, tables, views, and lineage information, ensuring dbt can profile and document your data while preventing any modifications.

Replace `your-database` with the name of a Snowflake database to grant metadata access. Repeat this block for each relevant database:

```
SET db_var = '"<your-database>"';

-- Grant access to view the database and its schemas
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;

-- Grant REFERENCES to enable lineage and dependency analysis
GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;

-- Recommended grant SELECT for privileges to enable metadata introspection and profiling
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;

-- Grant MONITOR on dynamic tables (e.g., for freshness or status checks)
GRANT MONITOR ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE IDENTIFIER($db_var) TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
```

## Grant access to Snowflake metadata[​](#grant-access-to-snowflake-metadata "Direct link to Grant access to Snowflake metadata")

This step grants the dbt role (`dbt_metadata_role`) access to Snowflake’s system-level database, enabling it to read usage statistics, query histories, and lineage information required for comprehensive metadata insights.

Grant privileges to read usage stats and lineage from Snowflake’s system-level database:

```
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE dbt_metadata_role;
```

## Important considerations[​](#important-considerations "Direct link to Important considerations")

The following are best practices for external metadata ingestion, designed to ensure consistent, reliable, and scalable integration of metadata from third-party systems.

* Catalog unifies the shared resources between dbt and Snowflake. For example, if there’s a Snowflake table that represents a dbt model, these are represented as a single resource in Catalog. In order for proper unification to occur, the same connection must be used by both the [production environment](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#set-as-production-environment) and the external metadata ingestion credential.
* Avoid duplicates: Use one metadata connection per platform if possible (for example, one for Snowflake, one for BigQuery).
  + Having multiple connections pointing to the same warehouse can cause duplicate metadata.
* Align with dbt environment: To unify asset lineage and metadata, ensure the same warehouse connection is used by both the dbt environment and the external metadata ingestion.
* Use filters to limit ingestion to relevant assets:
  + For example: restrict to production schemas only, or ignore transient/temp schemas.

External metadata ingestion runs daily at 5 PM UTC, and also runs immediately each time you update and save credentials.
