Hi all, I’m Kshitij, a senior software engineer on the Core team at dbt Labs.
One of the coolest moments of my career here thus far has been shipping the new `dbt clone` command as part of the dbt-core v1.6 release.

However, one of the questions I’ve received most frequently is guidance around “when” to clone that goes beyond [the documentation on “how” to clone](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/clone).
In this blog post, I’ll attempt to provide this guidance by answering these FAQs:

1. What is `dbt clone`?
2. How is it different from deferral?
3. Should I defer or should I clone?
