Self-service Starter accounts are a quick and easy way to get dbt up and running for a small team.

For teams looking to scale and access advanced features like SSO, group management, and support for larger user bases, upgrading to an [Enterprise-tier](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions) account unlocks these capabilities — if you're interested in upgrading, contact [dbt Labs today](https://www.getdbt.com/contact).

## Groups and permissions[​](#groups-and-permissions "Direct link to Groups and permissions")

Groups determine a user's permission and there are three groups are available for the Starter plan dbt accounts: Owner, Member, and Everyone. The first Owner user is the person who created the dbt account.

New users are added to the Member and Everyone groups when they onboard but this can be changed when the invitation is created. These groups only affect users with a [Developer license](#licenses) assigned.

The group access permissions are as follows:

* **Owner** — Full access to account features.
* **Member** — Robust access to the account with restrictions on features that can alter billing or security.
* **Everyone** — A catch-all group for all users in the account. This group does not have any permission assignments beyond the user's profile. Users must be assigned to either the Member or Owner group to work in dbt.

## Licenses[​](#licenses "Direct link to Licenses")

You assign licenses to every user onboarded into dbt. You only assign Developer-licensed users to the Owner and Member groups. The groups have no impact on Read-only or IT licensed users.

There are three license types:

* **Developer** — The default license. Developer licenses don't restrict access to any features, so users with this license should be assigned to either the Owner or Member group. You're allotted up to 8 developer licenses per account.
* **Read-Only** — Read-only access to your project, including environments Catalog. Doesn't have access to account settings at all. Functions the same regardless of group assignments. You're allotted up to 5 read-only licenses per account.
* **IT** — Partial access to the account settings including users, integrations, billing, and API settings. Cannot create or edit connects or access the project at all. Functions the same regardless of group assignments. You're allocated 1 seat per account.

See [Seats and Users](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) for more information on the impact of licenses on these permissions.

License types override group permissions

**User license types always override their assigned group permission sets.** For example, a user with a Read-Only license cannot perform administrative actions, even if they belong to an Account Admin group.

This ensures that license restrictions are always enforced, regardless of group membership.

## Table of groups, licenses, and permissions[​](#table-of-groups-licenses-and-permissions "Direct link to Table of groups, licenses, and permissions")

Key:

* (W)rite — Create new or modify existing. Includes `send`, `create`, `delete`, `allocate`, `modify`, and `read`.
* (R)ead — Can view but can not create or change any fields.
* No value — No access to the feature.

Permissions:

* [Account-level permissions](#account-permissions-for-account-roles) — Permissions related to management of the dbt account. For example, billing and account settings.
* [Project-level permissions](#project-permissions-for-account-roles) — Permissions related to the projects in dbt. For example, Catalog and the Studio IDE.

The following tables outline the access that users have if they are assigned a Developer license and the Owner or Member group, Read-only license, or IT license.
