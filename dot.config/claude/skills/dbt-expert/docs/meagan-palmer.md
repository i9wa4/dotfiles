## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

I was fortunate that Jon Bradley at Nearmap had the vision to engage the then Fishtown Analytics team (as the dbt Labs team was formerly called) as consultants and begin using dbt in our stack. I can't thank him enough. It was a turning point for my career, where I could combine my interests and experiences in delivering business value, data, product management, and software engineering practices.

## Which dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#which-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to Which dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

Being in Australia, I often see replies from [Jeremy Yeo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyyeo/) to people in the dbt Slack. His clarity of communication is impressive.

For growth, I'm hoping that others can benefit from the wide range of experience I have. My LinkedIn Newsletter, [Analytics Engineering Today](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/analytics-engineering-today-7210968984693690370/) aims to upskill the dbt Community and shed some light on some useful features that might not be well known.

I was at [Coalesce Online](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/)and am doing some webinars/events later in the year. Come say hi, I love talking dbt and analytics engineering with people.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

The community members are amazing. It's great to be among a group of people that want to learn and improve.
I've learned a lot - both from other members helping with my queries and in reading how other businesses have implemented dbt, including their stories on the organizational & technical issues they face.

I hope I can help instill a sense that simple, clean solutions are possible and preferable. I want to highlight that it is important to focus on what is the actual problem you are trying to solve and the fact that it's worth asking for help when you're starting to get stuck.

I'm keen to help more women get the courage to work & lead in STEM. There has been a lot of progress made over the course of my career which is great to see. Australian/NZ women, please connect with me, happy to chat.
