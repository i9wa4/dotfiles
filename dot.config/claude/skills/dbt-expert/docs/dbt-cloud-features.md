dbt platform (formerly dbt Cloud) is the fastest and most reliable way to deploy dbt. Develop, test, schedule, document, and investigate data models all in one browser-based UI.

In addition to providing a hosted architecture for running dbt across your organization, dbt comes equipped with turnkey support for scheduling jobs, CI/CD, hosting documentation, monitoring and alerting, an integrated development environment (Studio IDE), and allows you to develop and run dbt commands from your local command line interface (CLI) or code editor.

dbt's [flexible plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/) and features make it well-suited for data teams of any size — sign up for your [free 14-day trial](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/)!
