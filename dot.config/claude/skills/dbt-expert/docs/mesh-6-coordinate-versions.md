Coordinating model versions across your mesh is a critical part of the model versioning process. This guide will walk you through the safe best practices for coordinating producers and consumers when introducing model versions.

An important part of our dbt Mesh workflow is [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions). This enables better data model management and is critical in a scenario where multiple teams share models across projects.

Releasing a new model version safely requires coordination between model producers (who build the models) and model consumers (who depend on them).

This guide goes over the following topics:

* [How producers introduce new model versions safely](#best-practices-for-producers)
* [How consumers evaluate and migrate to those new versions](#best-practices-for-consumers)

For how versioning works at a technical level (YAML structure, contracts, aliasing), see [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions).

## Best practices for producers[​](#best-practices-for-producers "Direct link to Best practices for producers")

Producers own the creation, rollout, communication, and deprecation of model versions. The following steps go over what producers should do when introducing a new version of a model.

* [Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version](#step-1-decide-when-a-changes-needs-a-new-version)
* [Step 2: Create the new version safely](#step-2-create-the-new-version-safely)
* [Step 3: Add a deprecation date](#step-3-add-a-deprecation-date)
* [Step 4: Communicate the new version](#step-4-communicate-the-new-version)
* [Step 5: Remove the old version](#step-5-remove-the-old-version)
* [Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions](#step-6-clean-up-deprecated-versions)

#### Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version[​](#step-1-decide-when-a-change-needs-a-new-version "Direct link to Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version")

When creating an original version of a model, use [model contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) to ensure that breaking changes produce errors during development. The model contract ensures you, as a producer, are not changing the shape or data type of the output model. If a change breaks the contract, like removing or changing a column type, this means you should create a new model contract, and thus a new model version.

Here are some examples of breaking changes that might need a new version:

* Removing a column
* Renaming a column
* Changing a column type

Here are some examples of non-breaking changes:

* Adding a new column
* Fixing a bug in an existing column

Here are examples of changes that might be breaking depending on your business logic:

* Changing logic behind a metric
* Changing granularity
* Modifying filters
* Rewriting `CASE` statements

#### Step 2: Create the new version safely[​](#step-2-create-the-new-version-safely "Direct link to Step 2: Create the new version safely")

After deciding that a change needs a new [version](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions), follow these steps to create the new version without disrupting existing workflows. Let's say you're removing a column:

1. Create a new version of the model file. For example, `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2.sql`. Each version of a model must have its own SQL file.
2. Keep the default version stable. In the model's `properties.yml` file:

   * Set [`versions`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions) to include the old version and the new version: `- v: 1` and `- v: 2` respectively.
   * Set the [`latest_version:`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/latest_version) to `latest_version: 1`.

   This ensures that downstream consumers using `ref(...)` won’t accidentally start using v2. Without setting this, the default will be the highest numerical version, which could be a breaking change for consumers.
3. Set an [alias](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/alias) or create a view over the latest model version. By aliasing or creating a view over the latest model version, you ensure `fishtown_analytics_orders` (without the version suffix) always exists as an object in the warehouse, pointing to the latest version. This also protects external tools and BI dashboards.

#### Step 3: Add a deprecation date[​](#step-3-add-a-deprecation-date "Direct link to Step 3: Add a deprecation date")

1. In the model's `properties.yml` file, set a [`deprecation_date`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/deprecation_date) for the model's old version. The `deprecation_date` is a date in the future that signifies when the old version will be removed.

   This notifies downstream consumers and will appear in the `dbt run` logs as a warning that the old version is nearing deprecation and consumers will need to [migrate](#best-practices-for-consumers) to the new version.

   models/properties.yml

   ```
   models:
     - name: fishtown_analytics_orders
       latest_version: 1
       columns:
         - name: column_to_remove
         - name: column_to_keep

       versions:
         - v: 1                 # old version — uses all top-level columns
           deprecation_date: "2025-12-31"
         - v: 2                 # new version
           columns:
             - include: all
               exclude: [column_to_remove]   # <— specify which columns were removed in v2
   ```
2. Merge the new version into the main branch.
3. Run the job to build the new version.
4. Verify that the new version builds successfully.
5. Verify that the deprecation date is set correctly in the `dbt run` logs.

If you try to reference models (for example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'model_name', v=1) }}`) using the `v=1` argument after the deprecation date, the `ref` call will fail once the producer project removes the `v1` version.

#### Step 4: Communicate the new version[​](#step-4-communicate-the-new-version "Direct link to Step 4: Communicate the new version")

After creating a new version and setting a deprecation date for the old version, communicate the new version to downstream consumers. Let them know that:

* A new version is available and a deprecation timeline exists.
* Consumers can test the new version and [migrate](#best-practices-for-consumers) over.
* To test the new version, consumers can use `v=2` when referencing the model. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'model_name', v=2) }}`.

#### Step 5: Remove the old version[​](#step-5-remove-the-old-version "Direct link to Step 5: Remove the old version")

Once the consumers confirm they've tested and migrated over to the new version, you can set the new version as the latest version:

models/properties.yml

```
models:
  - name: fishtown_analytics_orders
    latest_version: 2 # update from 1 to 2 to set the new version as the latest version
    versions:
      - v: 1 # this represents the old version
      - v: 2 # this represents the new version
```

This then updates the default `ref` to the new version. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders') }}` will now resolve to the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2` model in the `upstream_project`. If consumers want to use the old version, they can use `v=1` when referencing the model: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=1) }}`.

#### Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions[​](#step-6-clean-up-deprecated-versions "Direct link to Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions")

After all consumers have [migrated](#best-practices-for-consumers) to the new version, you can clean up the deprecated version. You could choose to "hard delete" all old versions, or "soft delete" them for continuity.

* Hard delete (cleanest)* Soft delete (retains continuity)

"Hard deleting" old versions is the cleanest approach and removes all old version artifacts from your project:

1. Delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1.sql` file and rename the new version back to `fishtown_analytics_orders.sql`.
2. Delete all version specifications from your `.yml` file.
3. Drop or delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1` object from your warehouse with a manual script or using a cleanup macro.

"Soft deleting" old versions retains all old version artifacts to avoid confusion if more model versions get introduced in future, and for continuity. Bear in mind that your version control platform will also have the history of all of these changes.

1. Repoint the `fishtown_analytics_orders` alias to your latest version file (for example, `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2`), or create a view on top of the latest model version.
2. Use the `enabled` [config option](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/enabled) to disable the deprecated model version so that it doesn’t run in dbt jobs and can’t be referenced in a cross-project ref. For example:

   models/properties.yml

   ```
   models:
     - name: fishtown_analytics_orders
       latest_version: 1
       columns:
         - name: column_to_remove
         - name: column_to_keep

       versions:
         - v: 1                 # old version — uses all top-level columns
           deprecation_date: "2025-12-31"
           config:
             enabled: false  #  disable deprecated version so it no longer runs
         - v: 2                 # new version
           columns:
             - include: all
               exclude: [column_to_remove]   # <— specify which columns were removed in v2
   ```
3. Drop or delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1` object from your warehouse with a manual script or appropriate process or using a cleanup macro.

... and that's it! You should now have a new version of the model and a deprecated version. The next section is meant for consumers to evaluate and migrate to the new version.

## Best practices for consumers[​](#best-practices-for-consumers "Direct link to Best practices for consumers")

Consumers rely on upstream models and need to make sure that version transitions don’t introduce unintended breakages. Refer to the following steps to migrate to the new version:

1. Begin writing a cross-project reference to use a public model from a different project. In this case, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders') }}`.
2. Once you see deprecation warnings, test the latest version of a model by explicitly referencing it in your `ref`. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=2) }}`. Check if it's a breaking change for you or has any unintended impacts on your project.
   * If it does, consider explicitly “pinning” to the current, working version of the model before the new version becomes the default: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=1) }}`. Bear in mind that you will need to migrate at some point before the deprecation date.
3. Before the deprecation date, you can migrate to the new version of the model by removing the version specification in your cross-project reference: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders')`. Make any downstream logic changes needed to accommodate this new version.

Consumers should plan migrations to align with their own team’s release cycles.
