You're now following best practices in your project, and have optimized the materializations of your DAG. You’re equipped with the 3 main materializations that cover almost any analytics engineering situation!

There are more configs and materializations available, as well as specific materializations for certain platforms and adapters — and like everything with dbt, materializations are extensible, meaning you can create your own [custom materializations](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/create-new-materializations) for your needs. So this is just the beginning of what you can do with these powerful configurations.

For the vast majority of users and companies though, tables, views, and incremental models will handle everything you can throw at them. Develop your intuition and expertise for these materializations, and you’ll be well on your way to tackling advanced analytics engineering problems.
