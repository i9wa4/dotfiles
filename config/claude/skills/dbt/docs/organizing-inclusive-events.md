The dbt community is filled with dedicated community leaders who create opportunities for connection, learning and professional development within the analytics community.

This guide is a resource to help organizers execute **inclusive digital events**. We understand that organizers, presenters, speakers, etc. might not be able to apply these tips to *every* event, but this guide will offer some food for thought.

Additionally, this list can grow. If you would like to contribute a tip, please email [community@dbtlabs.com](mailto:community@dbtlabs.com).

## General logistics[​](#general-logistics "Direct link to General logistics")

* Try to choose a date that does not overlap with [holidays](http://www.holidayscalendar.com/months/) or general major events. Don’t forget to check international holidays (if applicable)
* Avoid really large national/local events (i.e. World Cup)

## Marketing[​](#marketing "Direct link to Marketing")

* If you are using photos, share images that include community members with a wide range of presentations, including people from underrepresented groups.
* Put event accessibility information on your event page (i.e. “closed captioning available for all video resources”)
* In the registration process provide an opportunity for attendees to:
  + share pronouns
  + ask questions in advance
  + request specific needs or other accommodations (interpreting services, braille transcription, dietary restrictions, etc.)
* If this is a paid event (e.g. a conference), create a scholarship for attendees that might need financial support
* Think about how you are promoting your event — are you reaching underrepresented communities, marginalized populations and people who might not have access to the internet?

## Programming[​](#programming "Direct link to Programming")

* Book diverse speakers. Include speakers that represent underrepresented and marginalized populations.
* Do research on your speakers. Is there any reason that your speakers would make the audience uncomfortable?
* Design an [accessible presentation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/)
* If possible, share a recording after the event for community members who are not able to make it and add closed captioning.
* Ask speakers to introduce themselves before starting their presentation, so that transcription services can capture who is talking.

## Digital platforms for online events[​](#digital-platforms-for-online-events "Direct link to Digital platforms for online events")

* Take a minute or two to explain the features of the platform that attendees will be using in the beginning of the event
* Offer the option for attendees to dial-in by phone and participate without a computer or internet
* Explore the accessibility features your platform offers and apply it where necessary (i.e. closed captioning, automatic transcripts, screen reader support, etc.)
* Check if your platform is compatible with assistive technology

## Attendee communication[​](#attendee-communication "Direct link to Attendee communication")

* Make sure that attendees have any addresses, links, codes, numbers to accessing the event beforehand
* Share the agenda of the event beforehand so that attendees are able to make arrangements (if necessary)
* Share contact information with attendees so that they are able to reach out with questions before and after the event.
* Ask attendees for feedback in a post-event survey so that you are able to improve future experiences.

## Speaker communication[​](#speaker-communication "Direct link to Speaker communication")

* Ask speakers how to pronounce their names before the event
* Ask speakers for their pronouns before the event
* Suggest that speakers use headphones to ensure clear audio
* Ask speakers to use plain language and avoid jargon, slang, idioms, etc.
