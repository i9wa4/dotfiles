Hi! We’re Christine and Carol, Resident Architects at dbt Labs. Our day-to-day
work is all about helping teams reach their technical and business-driven goals.
Collaborating with a broad spectrum of customers ranging from scrappy startups
to massive enterprises, we’ve gained valuable experience guiding teams to
implement architecture which addresses their major pain points.

The information we’re about to share isn't just from our experiences - we
frequently collaborate with other experts like Taylor Dunlap and Steve Dowling
who have greatly contributed to the amalgamation of this guidance. Their work
lies in being the critical bridge for teams between
implementation and business outcomes, ultimately leading teams to align on a
comprehensive technical vision through identification of problems and solutions.

**Why are we here?**
We help teams with dbt architecture, which encompasses the tools, processes and
configurations used to start developing and deploying with dbt. There’s a lot of
decision making that happens behind the scenes to standardize on these pieces -
much of which is informed by understanding what we want the development workflow
to look like. The focus on having the ***perfect*** workflow often gets teams
stuck in heaps of planning and endless conversations, which slows down or even
stops momentum on development. If you feel this, we’re hoping our guidance will
give you a great sense of comfort in taking steps to unblock development - even
when you don’t have everything figured out yet!

If you're reading this article, it looks like you're wondering how you can better optimize your Redshift queries - and you're *probably* wondering how you can do that in conjunction with dbt.

In order to properly optimize, we need to understand **why** we might be seeing issues with our performance and **how** we can fix these with dbt [sort and dist configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/redshift-configs#using-sortkey-and-distkey).
