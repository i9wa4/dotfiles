Hello, community!

My name is Bruno, and you might have seen me posting dbt content on LinkedIn. If you haven't, let me introduce myself. I started working with dbt more than 3 years ago. At that time, I was very new to the tool, and to understand it a bit better, I started creating some resources to help me with dbt learning. One of them, a dbt cheatsheet, was the starting point for my community journey.

I went from this cheatsheet to creating all different kinds of content, contributing and engaging with the community, until I got the dbt community award two times, and I am very thankful and proud about that.

Since the acquisition of SDF Labs by dbt Labs, I have been waiting for the day that we would see what the result of the fusion of these two companies would be. Spoiler alert: It’s the dbt Fusion engine and it's better than I could have expected.
