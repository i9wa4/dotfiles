As AI becomes more deeply integrated into data workflows, dbt users need a seamless way to access and integrate dbt's structured metadata and execution context effectively. This page provides an overview of dbt's MCP Server, which exposes this context, supporting use cases such as conversational access to data, agent-driven automation of dbt workflows, and AI-assisted development.

The [dbt Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp) provides a standardized framework that enables users to seamlessly integrate AI applications with dbt-managed data assets regardless of the underlying data platforms. This ensures consistent, governed access to models, metrics, lineage, and freshness across various AI tools.

The MCP server provides access to the dbt CLI, [API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/overview), the [Discovery API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api), and [Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl). It provides access to private APIs, text-to-SQL, and SQL execution.

For more information on MCP, have a look at [Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## Server access[​](#server-access "Direct link to Server access")

You can use the dbt MCP server in two ways: locally or remotely. Choose the setup that best fits your workflow:

### Local MCP server[​](#local-mcp-server "Direct link to Local MCP server")

The local MCP server provides the best experience for development workflows, like authoring dbt models, tests, and documentation.

The [local MCP server](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-ai/setup-local-mcp) runs on your machine and requires installing `uvx` (which installs dbt-mcp locally). This option provides:

* Full access to dbt CLI commands (`dbt run`, `dbt build`, `dbt test`, and more)
* Support for dbt Core, Cloud CLI, and dbt Fusion Engine
* Ability to work with local dbt projects without requiring a dbt platform account
* Optional integration with dbt platform APIs for metadata discovery and Semantic Layer access

### Remote MCP server[​](#remote-mcp-server "Direct link to Remote MCP server")

The remote MCP server from dbt offers data consumption use cases without local setup.

The [remote MCP server](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-ai/setup-remote-mcp) connects to the dbt platform via HTTP and requires no local installation. This option is useful when:

* You either don’t want to install, or are restricted from installing, additional software on your system.
* Your use case is primarily consumption-based (for example, querying metrics, exploring metadata, viewing lineage).

info

Remote dbt MCP tools are dependent on available dbt Copilot credits. Note that the SQL and remote Fusion tools are in this category, even when they are used and proxied through the local dbt MCP server. Most MCP tools don't consume dbt Copilot credits. However, [`text_to_sql`](#sql) usage does count toward your dbt Copilot consumption.

If you reach your dbt Copilot usage limit, all tools will be blocked until your Copilot credits reset. If you need help, please reach out to your account manager.

## Available tools[​](#available-tools "Direct link to Available tools")

### Supported[​](#supported "Direct link to Supported")

The dbt MCP server has access to many parts of the dbt experience related to development, deployment, and discovery. Here are the categories of tools supported based on what form of the MCP server you connect to as well as detailed information on exact commands or queries available to the LLM.

Note that access to the Discovery API and the Semantic Layer API is limited depending on your [plan type](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing).

### dbt CLI commands[​](#dbt-cli-commands "Direct link to dbt CLI commands")

* `build`: Executes models, tests, snapshots, and seeds in dependency order
* `compile`: Generates executable SQL from models, tests, and analyses without running them
* `docs`: Generates documentation for the dbt project
* `ls` (list): Lists resources in the dbt project, such as models and tests
* `parse`: Parses and validates the project’s files for syntax correctness
* `run`: Executes models to materialize them in the database
* `test`: Runs tests to validate data and model integrity
* `show`: Runs a query against the data warehouse

Allowing your client to utilize dbt commands through the MCP tooling could modify your data models, sources, and warehouse objects. Proceed only if you trust the client and understand the potential impact.
