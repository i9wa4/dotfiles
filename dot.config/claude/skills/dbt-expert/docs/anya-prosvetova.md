## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?[​](#when-did-you-join-the-dbt-community-and-in-what-way-has-it-impacted-your-career "Direct link to When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?")

A few years back, I became a member of the dbt Community, but it wasn't until about a year ago, when I started using dbt at work, that I began actively engaging with it. Being the only data person in my company, the Community became a valuable resource for me to learn and ask questions. It's an excellent platform to gain insights from others, exchange experiences, and stay up-to-date with the latest product features.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?[​](#what-dbt-community-leader-do-you-identify-with-how-are-you-looking-to-grow-your-leadership-in-the-dbt-community "Direct link to What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?")

What I enjoy about the dbt Community is that its thought leaders are focused on working together to create a culture of mutual support and shared learning. Everyone is welcome to ask a question or share their latest blog without the fear of being judged. I believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute to the community, and I hope to help facilitate this supportive and collaborative environment where we can all learn from each other.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?[​](#what-have-you-learned-from-community-members-what-do-you-hope-others-can-learn-from-you "Direct link to What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?")

I've learned a lot about best practices for working with dbt and data in general, as well as tips and tricks for specific use cases. I've also gained a better understanding of the diverse range of data challenges that people face in different industries and contexts.

As for what I hope others can learn from me, I aim to share my own experiences and knowledge in a way that is approachable and useful to people at all skill levels and backgrounds.
