dbt provides two types of browser support:

* Fully supported — dbt is fully tested and supported on these browsers. Features display and work as intended.
* Best effort — You can access dbt on these browsers. Features may not display or work as intended.

You may still be able to access and use dbt even without using the latest recommended browser or an unlisted browser. However, some features might not display as intended.

To improve your experience using dbt, we suggest that you turn off ad blockers.

### Browser sessions[​](#browser-sessions "Direct link to Browser sessions")

A session is a period of time during which you’re signed in to a dbt account from a browser. If you close your browser, it will end your session and log you out. You'll need to log in again the next time you try to access dbt.

If you've logged in using [SSO](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview), you can customize your maximum session duration, which might vary depending on your identity provider (IdP).
